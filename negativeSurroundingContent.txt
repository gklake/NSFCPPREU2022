I saw on other forums but its use js i don^t think its good  simple is best Would be helpful to have this as a separate page on the website with all the formatting options.   Link to this page should appear in the bottom while posting replies or new threads. This is what a proper thread should look like  It makes your paragraphs of wisdom easier for the eyes to read and in general just looks fucking awesome.   On a serious note though I have found there to be a lack of clarification about how you can format your threads so this should make things easy.     TEXT STYLE   Any styling and formatting is done using square brackets in the following format: [...] [/...]   To color your text simply replace the dots with color and then specify which one you want as follows:   (color=red)  your text goes here  (/color)   In your case use square brackets instead of round ones.  You can also use HEX just add a # like so: color=#BCECE0    You can also use bold italics or underline on your text using (b) (i) and (u) in that order and lastly you can also strikethrough your text using (s)   Just don^t forget the closing brackets like in HTML    FORMATTING PARAGRAPHS     To create a list just use (list) and (/list) as well as (*) for each new element in the list unless it^s ordered in which case you use (list=1) and (/list) or (list=a) and (/list). You get the idea   If you want to post a chunk of code use (code) and (/code) just note that colors won^t work within the brackets.   Want to center your text? Just wrap it in (align=center) and (/align). Here again you can get creative with =right =left etc.      LINKS & PIX   Embedding urls in text is usually frowned upon in the darknet so I discourage you from using it but you do it using (url=https://..) and (/url) where and is the word being hyperlinked   There^s also (email) (/email) which is self explanatory   Lastly you can do (img) (/img) with a url of an image inbetween. Upload your picture here (for example):  and put it inbetween the [img] tags.     CLOSING REMARKS   Granted this thread looks over-the-top and a bit metrosexual but I was making a point alright? While the essence of what you post is what is truly important I still urge you to consider upping the font-size or emphasizing important parts using bold lettering just to make it more easy to read for your fellow members.    You can also click reply on this thread to see all the formatting in action. The style is called BBCode and you can look up more stuff online.      Until next time fellas You have an interesting way of portraying things BGrabbit.   Still nice post for newbies +1 Thanks for this Thread

Different tools and services will offer IP Geolocation which is NOT accurate at all and does not give location of the target instead it is the approximate location of the ISP and only with a official warrant from a legal department you can send a request to the ISP to request who was behind a specific IP address at a specific time and you^re still missing one important information to drill down the user: the port.  For that reason if we^re talking about smartphone users one of the most reliable things you can do is to use a simple social engineering tool like Seeker. It uses HTML API and gets Location Permission and then grabs Longitude and Latitude using GPS Hardware which is present in the device if the GPS Hardware is not present such as on a Laptop Seeker fallback to IP Geolocation or it will look for Cached Coordinates.  Generally if a user accepts location permission Accuracy of the information received is accurate to approximately 30m I^ve seen cases where the accuracy was around 5m-7m =)  Enjoy it:  (08-06-2021 07:00 PM)Ultimatefreshvodka Wrote: Hi dear Community    Someone knows how find the location of a phone^s number ?

Only LE has that kind of access to networks with pinpoint accuracy.   Phone number are constructed in different parts like CC numbers. Normally there is country code (2-3 digit) then another few digits specific to regions which will give you a few more infos. If you know the country of origin this will give a good indication of where or what kind of number it may be or what network it^s on.  You can also search the number on search engines could try adding them on whatsapp and msg them grabber link. Could try registries like 192[dot]com. If you have access to leaked DBs you can search there.  Otherwise you can pay someone to doxx the number for you. Hi dear Community    Someone knows how find the location of a phone^s number ?

I assume that this method has got some risk applications because you have advised us to have a backup before trying it out.You can try lolcat too. Although this method might not give many colors to our hearts desire but if we just want to make our terminal colorful and give it a new life then locat is worth considering. You can have a look at this project in the link given below:    Code:$ sudo snap install lolcat {snap must be installed prior installing lolcat}  $ brew install lolcat {for mac os users} You can install snap in debian based distros with the help of this command Code:$ sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get install snapd You will get your output of your system specs in rainbow colors & you can see your ram consumption by running this below stated command. Prior to that you should install neofetch. Screenfetch is also worth installing and it has got similar functions to that of neofetch. Installing lolcat and using it is the easiest way to get colors in terminal {at least in my opinion}. Code:$ sudo??apt-get install neofetch $ neofetch | lolcatSimilarly you can try installing screenfetch too   For the best results use terminator instead of tmux. I came to know that apt command does not have a stable CLI interface. We should always use with caution in scripts. Which means it have high possibility of breaking some of the packages in linux.If I was not using terminator then I would have not realized this basic fact.  Code:sudo apt-get install terminator  You can personalize you terminator and add some customized short-cut keys to it too. After all the name is so cool ""terminator"" this makes me feel like I am the protagonist in the movie TERMINATOR lol jokes apart lets keep going. I wish I could attach screenshot of updating my machine with lolcat and I wish I could show you the colorful output. May be @Power or @LongPig allow us to attach images in this forum.  Anyways you can try updating by using this command: Code:sudo apt-get update | lolcat  So if you ever want a colorful output just try typing "" | lolcat "" beside the command to get a colorful output.   Some Cool Stuff to do in Terminal when get Bored  Ever wonder if your machine can reply to you hi and hello messages? well there is an interesting package in snap which can be installed.  Code:$ sudo snap install hi $ sudo snap install helloOnce you have installed both of then them next time try running these commands: Code:$hi | lolcat $hello | lolcat {no need to type sudo this time for hi and hello commands}You will get interesting output every-time hi command will reply you with your operating system and hello command will reply you with ""hello world"". If you add ""| lolcat"" then you could get some colored output.  Sometimes simple hi & hello is not enough to kill a boredom How about if we get some proverb/wise words/positive and motivating quotes and some jokes? Well this can also be done in terminal. Code:$ sudo apt-get install fortune-modYou can add ""| lolcat"" to get colored output when installing this.  To get some inspiring words/jokes simply type: Code:$ fortune | lolcat In some tools like metasploit you must have seen a cow drawn in the terminal. You can get that too into your terminal with this command Code:sudo apt-get install cowsay Once that is installed you can try your new cow image in terminal on fortune mod. Let^s try it out. Code:$ fortune | cowsay | lolcat Again I wish if I could send the screenshot my colorful output but I am not aware if there exists a option through which I could insert my images in this post.

And kindly correct me if I am wrong.  FURTHER READING: _(package_manager) And if you are using snap only to install trusted and open-source stuff like lolcat {where you can view the code publicly} then in my opinion you should face no problems.  Quote:Although the Snap sandbox reduces the impact of a malicious app Canonical recommends users only install Snaps from publishers trusted by the user.  Quote: In one case in May 2018 two applications by the same developer were found to contain a cryptocurrency miner which ran in the background during application execution. When this issue was found Canonical removed the applications from the Snap Store and transferred ownership of the Snaps to a trusted third-party which re-published the Snaps without the miner present Just because once this incident happened it does not mean that we can never trust this package manager. Most developers tend to use this even today for the sake of ease of use and they win the trust of user by posting their code on open platforms like git hub and at the end transparency is maintained.

"Hello everybody  I am new to cryptocurrency mining and the student life isn^t handing me a big budget to spend on ASICs or at least a GPU.

Long story short I am interested to mine with the help of a mobile phone as a personal project hoping that maybe I can make some profit out of it as well.

Then I installed trupvot^s cpuminer-multi and joined slush pool but for some reason my worker isn^t even registered maybe I am doing something wrong?

The maximum hash rate reached was ~500kh and its lowest was 7kh... What^s the deal with these huge fluctuations why do they happen?  A third question would be what currencies could I mine profitably with the help of an android phone and should I join a mining pool if yes do you know any pools? At the moment i just started mining bitcoin with that phone but I don^t think I will ever make any profits with it.  Any information regarding phone mining is welcomed as well as mining in general. Thank you very much for your attention and answers  Best regards oS1 Its just not worth. With this setup it is just not worth your time put it in something more robust/ stable income. Mining is over hyped at the moment anyways. (04-15-2021 12:05 AM)oS1s10pNcKa3 Wrote: student life ... study and for programming.You^re sharing too much information.

What^s the deal with these huge fluctuations why do they happen?When your phone-screen turns off your phone^s CPU works slower. When you turn the phone back on the hashing rate might not increase because it doesn^t refresh on the program. If you ever use hashcat or something like that remember this and make sure to ""pause"" the cracking session when you^re relocating and continue it later. Or you can keep your device on at all times.  Your device also heats up which throttles the CPU .

I would recommend that you not physically sit down and install anything on the machines it^s easy for them to look at cameras and determine that it was you. Here is how I^d do it: 1. Compromise the network from the outside using infrastructure from other countries and connect to that infrastructure only through Tor/Whonix. You could make this easy for yourself by downloading a stager to one of the school^s machines and since people mistakenly download malware all the time you still have plausible deniability. 2. Use that initial network access to pivot through the machines e.g. in the school library and install your miner that way.  3. Periodically check to see how things are going and to withdraw funds from the mining pool to your XMR wallet.  Bear in mind that Tor protects the content of your traffic but its use is obvious on the network so if you^re the only person using Tor on campus you^ll generate some suspicion so you^ll need to solve that problem somehow e.g. by only connecting to the offshore infrastructure while off campus. This really boils down to good opsec so do some reading and hang out a bit more before you do it."

Like @INTERPOL says it^s easy.  The welcome message made me think we are supposed to go slow. Hi all  I^m new to the forum and the less sunny side of the internet. I have some experience with programming embedded devices in C and to some extend in assembly language. Computer-wise I know my way around Windows and Linux currently working on my shell scripting and python skills.  I know I need to learn more specifically about networking and deepen my knowledge about just about any other aspect but I^m up for a challenge (actually it was the ^become a member challeange^ that drew me to this community and I enjoyed solving it) and I have plenty of self drive.  I don^t quite have a direction in mind at the minute I find everything fascinating and I want to learn as much as I can and see where this takes me.  The fact that you care about the quality of the applicants is great and to me shows promise I could be in a company of people I could share my knowledge with and learn from.  Which brings me to my point: What are the actual expectations for the applicants? How will I know I^m ready to apply to become a full member?  Thanks o/ Well the expectations of a member is skills but desire to learn and become a better person beats all. If other members feel that you have the potential and desire for cyber security/hacking then you will become member in no time. Just stay active in forum and get +3 reputation.  This is how I become a member I am no better and I have no hacking or programming skills to brag about. Staying active in forum and making posts helped me get +3 reputation and in return I become full member.  And yes to get direction I suggest you to visit https://hide01.ir use a good download manager and vpn and download sans courses. Sans is best institute to learn any thing related to cyber security.  Quote:Sans sec560 for beginners in pentesting. Sans sec401 or Sans sec504 for blue teaming. And for forensics course you have to make your search.  Good luck buddy Try out one of the challenges over at: .php  If you^re struggiling with any of them then you know you^ll need to put in some more work.   Don^t let the challenges intimidate you as there is a wide range of knowledge spread across the members here. We all bring somethign different to the table but need to hold a standard so that the private section isn^t flooded with the usual crap of other forums. Thanks for your replies gents. I^ve already solved the programming challenge I shall look at the hacking one next...

please can a get a site that sells valid gift cards on the dark web or surface web at discounts hello  ABOUT ME : pretty new in this forum i have several questions about. But first of all I wanna say this isn^t my first and last post  I have more trust in this forum in front of BCW. I have used 3cards in my life for ordering - but they we^re all from my country and the job was easy.  About the experts :  Is it possible to clone EMV^s so to be able to withdraw from ATM^s ? I have idea of mine to realize a dream to be able to clone cards for pure cash and not selling the ordered...   2. Is it Best Carding World a scam ? It seems to be alright for my prespective but I have found a topic its total scam and they just scam newbies.  Nowadays I find to be able to get Dumps or CC into darkweb is easy but just asking if you have something to say about it   use this site to check for scam markets ive found it to be helpful.  That site is very outdated procede with caution. Better yet go to Dread for all DNM updates. - Hyperion (05-20-2022 01:14 AM)Xoxo Wrote: please can a get a site that sells valid gift cards on the dark web or surface web at discounts   no money return policy   (05-02-2022 09:11 PM)kiwart Wrote: About the experts :  Is it possible to clone EMV^s so to be able to withdraw from ATM^s ? I have idea of mine to realize a dream to be able to clone cards for pure cash and not selling the ordered... Is it possible? Yes. Here^s the problem. If you can find a card with a pin for sale that isn^t a scan (and they^re out there they^re just expensive) then you^re going to have to use those to learn how to code the chip. An alternative is to add a card to a wallet on an phone but you have to hope that the owner hasn^t already added it to that wallet. Also you run the risk of making a very small profit after you^re done paying for a card with pin ($750+ in my experience)  Your better options are to learn how to work with enrolled cards and find someone to accept the packages and pay your for them or to learn how to work with logs because that debit number + pin can be worth more if you send a wire and act really fast.

Hashcat has rules and masks. If someone does an interview about you there is a chance that they will put together information about you and break your password. Yes numbers like date of birth can be added to strings such as pet name school favorite team and so on. On a good GPU hashcat can do something like 14 billion hashes/second on MD5. So most combinations can be done in less than a second.  Eventually you will use this password on a site which will be dumped and eventually a site which uses a weak hashing algorithm.  If you use the same password on enough sites it^ll probably even be in a plaintext dump. Most plaintext dumps don^t get leaked for some reason but I know some big sites which have been hacked in the past and had plaintext dumps either in the database or in some log files. It^s really common so just don^t use the same password on different sites. if you want to generate random passwords locally you can run this bash script  Code:#/bin/bash choose() { echo ${1:RANDOM%${#1}:1} }  { ????choose ^-_+?@#$%^&^ ????choose ^0123456789^ ????choose ^abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz^ ????choose ^ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ^ ????for i in $( seq 1 $(( 20 + RANDOM % 25 )) ) ????do ????????choose ^0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ^ ????done } | sort -R | tr -d ^\n^ echo """" replace ""20 + RANDOM % 25"" with the range of the length you need and add or remove characters you do or do not want in  or  you can use an online strength tester to see how much time will a supercomputer takes to bruteforce a password and try different combinations to see how to increase its strength I^ve been worry about getting hacked.  So I was asking myself what do the OPSEC gods use when they make a password?  * Do you guys just use long weird words? Quote:1 Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis 2 Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious 3 Floccinaucinihilipilification  Do you just combine word and numbers?

Something easy to remember and long:   ThisIsMySecurePasswordButILikeSnowboardAndCheapWine7777andNotLikeRockMusic    And don^t write the truth about yourself in that password. Hashcat has rules and masks. If someone does an interview about you there is a chance that they will put together information about you and break your password. As the others suggested a longer password is a better one. Also do not reuse passwords.  The problem now will be that you have many accounts and many passwords. To remember all the passwords for all your accounts becomes bothersome after a short time. And if you have to remember a password for an account that you access twice a year you will quickly forget it.  I would suggest using a password manager to save your passwords (and your accounts). Now you will have to remember only one (hopefully very good) password. Also you will use this password all the time so there is no danger that you will forget it. Use a password manager such as keepass on a clean trusted computer with a memorized randomly generated strong password for the main database. It is a good way to get rid of the pain of remembering with a maintaining a higher level of security. If you are really paranoid about the password manager being compromised just memorize all of your passwords but I would still recommend securely generating them. For Mac users : If you??re on a Mac running a recent version of OS X your system comes with a built in password assistant. This tool can generate passwords that are easy to remember but hard to crack. To access this tool go to System Preferences > Accounts and click on your account. Click on Change Password then click on the key icon to see a password suggestion meeting various criteria. Click on the down arrow next to the suggested password to see more suggestions. I like to use long passwords random generated. Usually min. 24 Characters and add FIDO U2F if possible. Specially if the site contains something with my PII.  For a lot of people is a hustle carrying always a 2FA Key with them but not for me. Thank you guys for sharing your thoughts on this specially to @Err0r who shared a good shell script too.

"I2P is awesome and the software feels more polished than Tor or its hidden services feature. But Audience is massively different orders of magnitude larger for TOR than I2P.

Due to massive ddos on tor network why the market and tor network sites are not moving to I2P or at least having a I2P mirror is there anything wrong with I2P?  What are your general thoughts about I2P & Freenet when it compared to Tor browser. I think I2P is more private but less anonymous network. A huge number of people use Tor which makes Tor more anonymous on the other hand very few people actually use I2P so I think it^s not anonymous as Tor is if I2P can have more users it can also be more anonymous.

Its definitely worth checking out and there are a lot of vendors on there. Don^t worry so much about not speaking Russian on there though. There are plenty of people who speak English.

This guy is just going to keep the money don^t donate to him lol.  This Campaign Is Raised In HKD (1 USD = 7.7 HKD)   Hong Kong is famous for its economy food and speech freedom and now we are in a white terror. A new law which is approaching might harm our freedom since it can make anyone in jail by making up some tommyrot reasons. They can arrest anybody in Hong Kong even that person didn^t break the law of Hong Kong.  Therefore we are doing our best to fight for our freedom and we^re now having protests to make the government stop this law and release the peoples that were caught during the protests. But unfortunately there are more unimaginable things happen during the protest. Police use excessive force and tons of people got hurt apart from police using excessive force It^s so terrifying that police have cooperated with triads and allow them to beat protester passerby elderlies and even pregnants. It^s hard to believe official armed forces will cooperate with local triads to hurt civilians.  We need your help since we are almost out cause of buying first aid supplies for the front line and we do not have enough money to buy more. If you don^t help us we might suffer from having not enough first aid supplies. And protester might not have enough straightway treatment for their injuries. We cannot avoid all injuries but we can make the injury minimized.  Please fund us to buy saline to wash our eyes cause of the tear gas shot by the police we would also need gas mask and goggles to prevent tear gas. Helmets are also needed as police attack common people whom without weapons. We also need servers to distribute the latest news as WhatsApp and other main communication apps might be down cause of the DDOS internet attack by the Chinese government.   Please send me an email if anybody can provide anti-ddos servers for us to communicate.

"No?problem at all it is always nice if I can help someone out. If you have any other questions or problems feel free to ask them and we can try to solve them together Hey folks  I have been very little in this field in fact I have not even applied to be a member of the forum because unfortunately I can not contribute anything at the technical level for now but I am working on it.  I am taking my first steps with Python and Javascript and after read recently the admin^s post about attacking web im going to add some of the tips about it on my list thank you  I want to practice some basic pentesting. Try to attack a very simple website or start by being able to enter the wifi of some neighbors. Practice some attacks on emails cracking password spam etc.  Discipline is very important to me and I know that in this field taking things seriously from day 0 regardless of the level of what you are doing is vital. That is why I have been thinking about the best way to practice while maintaining the trail that I leave at 0 and having a good level of anonymity and privacy.  I have a little rasperry with Kali in an SD. I also have a much more powerful desktop but I don^t want to get used to it and I would like to keep everything in a low profile.  Here my doubts begin ... Some may not make sense or are obvious so I apologize:  I suppose that the ideal would be to do a MAC spoofing with the Raspbi get a VPN with good policy and then ....  Is it advisable to use a proxychain? Is it exclusive of the VPN? Combining both is a waste of time or would it be ideal? Tor has a place here?  Can I use all these measures and use my personal wifi or cable or would it be a very stupid idea? Otherwise would it be better to access a neighbor^s Wi-Fi or use a public Wi-Fi for all learning?  How can I take measures to keep a low profile while I practice taking a third party^s wifi?  I have researched and also studied the possibility of setting up a good VM environment on my PC for example with Qubes but I don^t know if it^s overkill or it wouldn^t solve anything.  Thank you Hey  Nice to hear you are learning programming and interested in learning penetration testing I see you are very aware of your own skills that is a very good thing. It is very important to know your skills it can prevent you from making mistakes in the future. Keep in mind that the ones that say they know everything are the ones who probably don^t even understand how broad the subject actually is.  If you are unsure of your capabilities to hide your tracks and to remain anonymous while practicing your skills I wouldn^t start attacking real websites quite yet. I would suggest to start first practicing with targets on your home network.  You can set up an old laptop as a server to host multiple different websites or just use virtual machines to host the targets. It is a good way to get started without risking anything yet. A good resource to get started is the OWASP Testing Guide it covers a lot of basics and is a good resource to refer back if you struggle to come up with things to test. OWASP JuiceShop is a very good intentionally vulnerable website to learn with it is the newest and is up-to-date with the latest web development trends.  A lot of OWASP resources here just keep in mind that OWASP is not the only source of information. For example reading HackerOne^s Hacktivity section (publicly disclosed vulnerabilities) is a very good way to start learning more advanced exploiting methods. Search for more material online there is an endless amount of valuable information like CVEs for example  You can find the testing guide here: .pdf OWASP JuiceShop:  OWASP Top Ten: _...29.pdf.pdf HackerOne^s Hacktivity: ?sort_ty...ge=forever  And when it comes to testing real websites it is a good idea to use Tor. Just hide that you are using Tor from your ISP. Also some sites are blocking traffic coming from Tor which might be a problem while performing attacks. So you need to hide your traffic before and after Tor. Something like VPN -> Tor -> VPS -> Target would hide Tor usage from your ISP and the target website.  Qubes itself is just a very secure (paranoid level) operating system it doesn^t offer anything for anonymity. Whonix instead is designed to route everything through Tor Whonix can be used as a gateway.  Just keep in mind that you can^t trust your ISP or VPN service (or anyone else to be honest) nobody will go jail for you or for your 20$ monthly payments. Use Tor to get the VPN (and everything else) up and running and pay with some way that can^t be connected to your identity (properly mixed cryptocurrency).  I hope I answered at least some of your questions Keep learning there is no shortcuts it is work work and work.

I have heard of Whonix so I will definitely investigate about it.  I had no record of OWASP so I think I have material to absorb and start moving for at least a few days .  Totally agree with what you mention about the skills at the beginning of your post. I don^t want to end up in a hole so the least I can do is make sure I crawl really well before thinking about being able to walk and take a false step that leads me where I don^t want to.  I will set up my own laboratory in the most realistic way possible and follow your advice before jumping into the ""real fire""  Again thank you very much for taking the time to write your answer.  Have a good day Here^s a privacy guide I found online - Offers some basic steps to privacy:  ...vacy-guide  Additionally if you^re thinking about using Whonix i^d recommend using it in a Qubes environment for additional protection.

An SMS gateway is an email address that is used to text a phone number. This way you can send texts to someone simply by using your email address.   The steps to do this are as follows:  1) Search the number you want to text and find the carrier assosiated with that number (There are many services online that do this - http://www.freesmsgateway.info ) 2) Find the SMS Gateway for this carrier (Ex. Verizon = {phoneNumber}@  3) Use a VPN (and/or Tor) and create a temp email and simply send an email to the SMS gateway  vioala - Anonymous SMS messages Is there any way to sent a sms without showing my number?

"Fatal error: the system has become unstable or is busy"" it says. ""Enter to return to Windows or press Control-Alt-Delete to restart your computer. If you do this you will lose any unsaved information in all open applications.""You have just been struck by the Blue Screen of Death. Anyone who uses Mcft Windows will be familiar with this. What can you do? More importantly how can you prevent it happening?1 Hardware conflictThe number one reason why Windows crashes is hardware conflict. Each hardware device communicates to other devices through an interrupt request channel (IRQ). These are supposed to be unique for each device.For example a printer usually connects internally on IRQ 7. The keyboard usually uses IRQ 1 and the floppy disk drive IRQ 6. Each device will try to hog a single IRQ for itself.If there are a lot of devices or if they are not installed properly two of them may end up sharing the same IRQ number. When the user tries to use both devices at the same time a crash can happen. The way to check if your computer has a hardware conflict is through the following route:* Start-Settings-Control Panel-System-Device Manager.Often if a device has a problem a yellow ^^ appears next to its description in the Device Manager. Highlight Computer (in the Device Manager) and press Properties to see the IRQ numbers used by your computer. If the IRQ number appears twice two devices may be using it.Sometimes a device might share an IRQ with something described as ^IRQ holder for PCI steering^. This can be ignored. The best way to fix this problem is to remove the problem device and reinstall it.Sometimes you may have to find more recent drivers on the internet to make the device function properly. A good resource is . If the device is a soundcard or a modem it can often be fixed by moving it to a different slot on the motherboard (be careful about opening your computer as you may void the warranty).When working inside a computer you should switch it off unplug the mains lead and touch an unpainted metal surface to discharge any static electricity.To be fair to Mcft the problem with IRQ numbers is not of its making. It is a legacy problem going back to the first PC designs using the IBM 8086 chip. Initially there were only eight IRQs. Today there are 16 IRQs in a PC. It is easy to run out of them. There are plans to increase the number of IRQs in future designs.2 Bad RamRam (random-access memory) problems might bring on the blue screen of death with a message saying Fatal Exception Error. A fatal error indicates a serious hardware problem. Sometimes it may mean a part is damaged and will need replacing.But a fatal error caused by Ram might be caused by a mismatch of chips. For example mixing 70-nanosecond (70ns) Ram with 60ns Ram will usually force the computer to run all the Ram at the slower speed. This will often crash the machine if the Ram is overworked.One way around this problem is to enter the BIOS settings and increase the wait state of the Ram. This can make it more stable. Another way to troubleshoot a suspected Ram problem is to rearrange the Ram chips on the motherboard or take some of them out. Then try to repeat the circumstances that caused the crash. When handling Ram try not to touch the gold connections as they can be easily damaged.Parity error messages also refer to Ram. Modern Ram chips are either parity (ECC) or non parity (non-ECC). It is best not to mix the two types as this can be a cause of trouble.EMM386 error messages refer to memory problems but may not be connected to bad Ram. This may be due to free memory problems often linked to old Dos-based programmes.3 BIOS settingsEvery motherboard is supplied with a range of chipset settings that are decided in the factory. A common way to access these settings is to press the F2 or delete button during the first few seconds of a boot-up.Once inside the BIOS great care should be taken. It is a good idea to write down on a piece of paper all the settings that appear on the screen. That way if you change something and the computer becomes more unstable you will know what settings to revert to.A common BIOS error concerns the CAS latency. This refers to the Ram. Older EDO (extended data out) Ram has a CAS latency of 3. Newer SDRam has a CAS latency of 2. Setting the wrong figure can cause the Ram to lock up and freeze the computer^s display.Mcft Windows is better at allocating IRQ numbers than any BIOS. If possible set the IRQ numbers to Auto in the BIOS. This will allow Windows to allocate the IRQ numbers (make sure the BIOS setting for Plug and Play OS is switched to ^yes^ to allow Windows to do this.).4 Hard disk drivesAfter a few weeks the information on a hard disk drive starts to become piecemeal or fragmented. It is a good idea to defragment the hard disk every week or so to prevent the disk from causing a screen freeze. Go to* Start-Programs-Accessories-System Tools-Disk DefragmenterThis will start the procedure. You will be unable to write data to the hard drive (to save it) while the disk is defragmenting so it is a good idea to schedule the procedure for a period of inactivity using the Task Scheduler.The Task Scheduler should be one of the small icons on the bottom right of the Windows opening page (the desktop).Some lockups and screen freezes caused by hard disk problems can be solved by reducing the read-ahead optimisation. This can be adjusted by going to* Start-Settings-Control Panel-System Icon-Performance-File System-Hard Disk.Hard disks will slow down and crash if they are too full. Do some housekeeping on your hard drive every few months and free some space on it. Open the Windows folder on the C drive and find the Temporary Internet Files folder. Deleting the contents (not the folder) can free a lot of space.Empty the Recycle Bin every week to free more space. Hard disk drives should be scanned every week for errors or bad sectors. Go to* Start-Programs-Accessories-System Tools-ScanDiskOtherwise assign the Task Scheduler to perform this operation at night when the computer is not in use.5 Fatal OE exceptions and VXD errorsFatal OE exception errors and VXD errors are often caused by video card problems.These can often be resolved easily by reducing the resolution of the video display. Go to* Start-Settings-Control Panel-Display-SettingsHere you should slide the screen area bar to the left. Take a look at the colour settings on the left of that window. For most desktops high colour 16-bit depth is adequate.If the screen freezes or you experience system lockups it might be due to the video card. Make sure it does not have a hardware conflict. Go to* Start-Settings-Control Panel-System-Device ManagerHere select the + beside Display Adapter. A line of text describing your video card should appear. Select it (make it blue) and press properties. Then select Resources and select each line in the window. Look for a message that says No Conflicts.If you have video card hardware conflict you will see it here. Be careful at this point and make a note of everything you do in case you make things worse.The way to resolve a hardware conflict is to uncheck the Use Automatic Settings box and hit the Change Settings button. You are searching for a setting that will display a No Conflicts message.Another useful way to resolve video problems is to go to* Start-Settings-Control Panel-System-Performance-GraphicsHere you should move the Hardware Acceleration slider to the left. As ever the most common cause of problems relating to graphics cards is old or faulty drivers (a driver is a small piece of software used by a computer to communicate with a device).Look up your video card^s manufacturer on the internet and search for the most recent drivers for it.6 VirusesOften the first sign of a virus infection is instability. Some viruses erase the boot sector of a hard drive making it impossible to start. This is why it is a good idea to create a Windows start-up disk. Go to* Start-Settings-Control Panel-Add/Remove ProgramsHere look for the Start Up Disk tab. Virus protection requires constant vigilance.A virus scanner requires a list of virus signatures in order to be able to identify viruses. These signatures are stored in a DAT file. DAT files should be updated weekly from the website of your antivirus software manufacturer.An excellent antivirus programme is McAfee VirusScan by Network Associates ( ). Another is Norton AntiVirus 2000 made by Symantec ( ).7 PrintersThe action of sending a document to print creates a bigger file often called a postscript file.Printers have only a small amount of memory called a buffer. This can be easily overloaded. Printing a document also uses a considerable amount of CPU power. This will also slow down the computer^s performance.If the printer is trying to print unusual characters these might not be recognised and can crash the computer. Sometimes printers will not recover from a crash because of confusion in the buffer. A good way to clear the buffer is to unplug the printer for ten seconds. Booting up from a powerless state also called a cold boot will restore the printer^s default settings and you may be able to carry on.8 SoftwareA common cause of computer crash is faulty or badly-installed software. Often the problem can be cured by uninstalling the software and then reinstalling it. Use Norton Uninstall or Uninstall Shield to remove an application from your system properly. This will also remove references to the programme in the System Registry and leaves the way clear for a completely fresh copy.The System Registry can be corrupted by old references to obsolete software that you thought was uninstalled. Use Reg Cleaner by Jouni Vuorio to clean up the System Registry and remove obsolete entries. It works on Windows 95 Windows 98 Windows 98 SE (Second Edition) Windows Millennium Edition (ME) NT4 and Windows 2000.Read the instructions and use it carefully so you don^t do permanent damage to the Registry. If the Registry is damaged you will have to reinstall your operating system. Reg Cleaner can be obtained from Often a Windows problem can be resolved by entering Safe Mode. This can be done during start-up. When you see the message ""Starting Windows"" press F4. This should take you into Safe Mode.Safe Mode loads a minimum of drivers. It allows you to find and fix problems that prevent Windows from loading properly.Sometimes installing Windows is difficult because of unsuitable BIOS settings. If you keep getting SUWIN error messages (Windows setup) during the Windows installation then try entering the BIOS and disabling the CPU internal cache. Try to disable the Level 2 (L2) cache if that doesn^t work.Remember to restore all the BIOS settings back to their former settings following installation.9 OverheatingCentral processing units (CPUs) are usually equipped with fans to keep them cool. If the fan fails or if the CPU gets old it may start to overheat and generate a particular kind of error called a kernel error. This is a common problem in chips that have been overclocked to operate at higher speeds than they are supposed to.One remedy is to get a bigger better fan and install it on top of the CPU. Specialist cooling fans/heatsinks are available from  or CPU problems can often be fixed by disabling the CPU internal cache in the BIOS. This will make the machine run more slowly but it should also be more stable.10 Power supply problemsWith all the new construction going on around the country the steady supply of electricity has become disrupted. A power surge or spike can crash a computer as easily as a power cut.If this has become a nuisance for you then consider buying a uninterrupted power supply (UPS). This will give you a clean power supply when there is electricity and it will give you a few minutes to perform a controlled shutdown in case of a power cut.It is a good investment if your data are critical because a power cut will cause any unsaved data to be lost. thank youfor the information"

The system is designed to be immediately configurable for a variety of different operating environments via a configuration file located on a floppy disk a local hard drive and/or a network via HTTP(S) FTP SFTP or SCP.The Sentry Firewall CD is a complete Linux system that runs off of an initial ramdisk much like a floppy-based system and a CD. The default kernel is a current 2.4.x series kernel with various Netfilter patches applied. An OpenWall-patched current 2.2.x kernel is also available on the CD.Booting from the CDROM is a fairly familiar process. The BIOS execs the bootloader(Syslinux) - which then displays a bootprompt and loads the kernel and ramdisk into memory. Once the kernel is running the ramdisk is then mounted as root(/). At this point our configuration scripts are run(written in perl) that configure the rest of the system. It is the job of these configure scripts to put the various startup and system files into the proper location using either what is declared in the configuration file(sentry.conf) or the system defaults located in the /etc/default directory.Most of the critical files used at boot time can be replaced with your own copy when declared in the configuration file. This is essentially how we allow the user to configure the system using his/her own configuration and init files.All of the binaries files scripts etc used to create the CD-ROM are also available on the CD-ROM. So with a little practice you can easily build and customize your own bootable Sentry Firewall CD. Please see the HOWTO for more details.Sentry Firewallht*p://.html#overview
"Configuring your Bulletproof FTP Server TutorialI am not sure where I found this tutorial It??s been a while??It might even have been here... ..So if it is one of yours my hat goes off to you once again....After reading the excellent tutorial on ""Creating an FTP"" that Norway posted??(I would suggest reading and following his tutorial first then following up with this one)I thought that perhaps this tutorial might be pretty helpful for those interested in knowing how to configure their Bulletproof FTP Server that don^t already know how... Here^s how to get started??This is for the BulletProof FTP Server 2.10. However It should work fine on most following versions as well.I^m assuming you have it installed and cracked.Basics1. Start the program.2. Click on Setup > Main > General from the pull-down menu.3. Enter your server name into the ^Server Name^ box. Under Connection set the ??Max number of users"" to any number. This is the limit as to how many users can be on your sever at any time.4. Click on the ^options^ tab of that same panel (on the side)5. Look at the bottom under IP Options. Put a check in the box ??Refuse Multiple Connections from the same IP??. This will prevent one person from blocking your FTP to others.6. Also put a check in the ^Blocked Banned IP (instead of notifying client). VERY IMPORTANT If somebody decides to ^Hammer^ (attempt to login numerous times VERY quickly) your server/computer may CRASH if you don^t enable this.7. Click on the ^advanced^ tab8. At the bottom again look at the ^hammering area^9. Enable ^anti-hammer^ and ^do not reply to people hammering^ Set it for the following: Block IP 120 min if 5 connections in 60 sec. You can set this at whatever you want to but that is pretty much a standard Click ^OK^Adding Users11. Setup > User accounts form pull-down.12. Right click in the empty ^User Accounts^ area on the right: choose ^Add^13. Enter account name. (ie: logon name)14. In the ^Access rights^ box right click: choose ??Add??.15. Browse until you find the directory (folder) you want to share. In the right column you will see a bunch of checkboxes. Put a check in the following ones: Read Write Append Make List and +Subdirs. Press ^select^.16. Enter a password for your new FTP account.17. Click on ^Miscellaneous^ in the left column. Make sure ^Enable Account^ is selected. Enable ^Max Number of Users^ set it at a number other than zero. 1 for a personal account and more that one for a group account. Enable ^Max. no. of connects per IP^ set it at 118. Under ^Files^ enable ^show relative path^ this is a security issue. A FTP client will now not be able to see the ENTIRE path of the FTP. It will only see the path from the main directory. Hide hidden flies as well.Put a tick in both of these.Advanced:You don^t need to do any of this stuff but It will help tweak your server and help you maintain order on it. All of the following will be broken down into small little areas that will tell you how to do one thing at a time.Changing the PortThe default port is always 21 but you can change this. Many ISPs will routinely do a scan of its own users to find a ftp server also when people scan for pubs they may scan your IP thus finding your ftp server. If you do decide to change it many suggest that you make the port over 10000.1. Setup > Main > General2. In the ^Connection^ Area is a setting labeled ^Listen on Port Number:^3. Make it any number you want. That will be your port number.4. Click ^OK^Making an ^Upload Only^ or ^Download Only^ ftp server.This is for the entire SERVER not just a user.1. Setup > Main > Advanced2. In the advanced window you will have the following options: uploads and downloads downloads only and uploads only. By default upload and download will be checked. Change it to whatever you want.3. Click ^OK??While you are running your server usually you will end up spending more time at your computer than you normally do. Don^t be afraid to ban IP^s. Remember on your FTP you do as you want.When you are online you must also select the open server button next to the on-line button which is the on-line ButtonYou also have to use the actual Numbered ip Address ie: 66.250.216.67Or even Better yet get a  address"
"Block Adserversf you wanna remove those nasty ads from the pages which waste lot of time and bandwidth then here is something for you I belive it will help you a lothow it worksIt^s possible to set up a name server as authoritative for any domain you choose allowing you to specify the DNS records for that domain. You can also configure most computers to be sort of mini-nameservers for themselves so that they check their own DNS records before asking a nameserver. Either way you get to say what hostname points to what IP address. If you haven^t guessed already the way you block ads it to provide bogus information about the domains we don^t want to see - ie all those servers out there that dedicate their existence to spewing out banner ads.The hosts fileProbably the most common way people block ads like this is with something called the ""hosts file"". The hosts file is a simple list of hostnames and their corresponding IP addresses which your computer looks at every time you try and contact a previously unknown hostname. If it finds an entry for the computer you^re trying to reach it sets the IP address for that computer to be whatever^s in the hosts file.127.0.0.1 is a special IP address which to a computer always means that computer. Any time a machine sends a network request to 127.0.0.1 it is talking to itself. This is very useful when it comes to blocking ads because all we have to do is specify the IP address of any ad server to be 127.0.0.1. And to do that all we have to do is edit the hosts file. What will happen then is something like this:  1. you visit a web page  2. the web page contains a banner ad stored on the server """"  3. your computer says ""? never heard of it. wait a second let^s see if I^ve got the number on me...""  4. your computer finds its hosts file and checks to see if  is listed  5. it finds the hostname which points to 127.0.0.1  6. ""great"" says the computer and sends off a request to 127.0.0.1 for the banner ad that^s supposed to be on the page  7. ""oh"" says the computer and fails to show anything because it just sent a request to itself for a banner ad  Where^s my hosts file?    * Windows 95 / 98 / ME: C:\Windows (I think)    * Windows NT: C:\WinNT\hosts    * Windows 2000: C:\WinNT\system32\drivers\etc\    * Windows XP: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc    * FreeBSD / Linux / Mac OS X / Unixish operating systems: /etc/hosts    * Classic Mac OS: please read this helpful information submitted by David ""iNerd"" B    * Mac OS 9: Marcia Skidmore sent in details that hopefully explain what you need to knowThe format of the hosts file is very simple - IP address whitespace then a list of hostnames (except for older Macs please see above). However you don^t need to know anything about the format if you don^t want to as you can just view the list hosts file.Of course that^s not the only way to use the list but it^s probably the most simple for most people.here is the hosts list which are serving you the ads just append it to your hosts file and enjoy ad free surfing makes things faster. if you want ad from certain site then just remove it from the list below.QUOTE127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1

For sale method and Bitcoin Transaction Hijacker Utx   Explore is a software that allows you to capture any transactions confirmed on the Blockchain.  In fact the software acts as an interface between the user and a Bitcoin mining server which in order to divert transactions greatly increases transaction fees enough to be transferred directly to your address.  The daily limit on the number of Bitcoins that the software can hijack can vary between 0.5 and 2 Bitcoins per day depending on the number of satoshi needed to be able to hijack this transaction. When hijacking an unconfirmed Bitcoin transaction you need to:  ?? Bitcoin transaction hijacker ?? UTX shell script ?? hash key ?? The hash of the transaction you want to hijack ?? Active Bitcoin address ?? Bitcoin Receipt (wallet address of preferred blockchain address)  After confirming your purchase we will support you to get the most out of our software.

"Next up I think there was a reference to ""cancel culture"". Here is my hyper controversial take are you guys & gals & nb^s ready for it???Cancel culture IS NOT A REAL ISSUE AND IS FUCKING IRRELEVANT. There I said it. What is cancel culture essentially? It^s a bunch of people disagreeing with you on twitter usually over something political. Every political side doest it yes the right cancels too I know big shock I can provide examples upon question. The thing is: when a bunch of people use their free speech to disagree with you publicly that is not an attack on your free speech like at all. That^s how public discourse works. No fascism there. Fascistic would be if the cops could come after you for saying stuff the government dont like.There are a few edge cases where people have lost their jobs due to ^cancel culture^. And most (99%) of the people affected didn^t lose their jobs because of cancellation but because of some other reason. For example saying or doing something that is illegal (like online defamation campaigns that just happen to affect trans people or whatever). Also many of the cancellation victims work in politics or entertainment. You know that one business sector where PR is everything. If they lose their job then it is because they cannot do their job with the bad PR they are attracting and that is kinda their fault. If a person gets fired for promoting rape or ethnic clensing none of us would complain and the reasoning behind it is the same. Bad PR represents the label/company in a bad way we want our customers to feel supported by us and give us da big maaaaney $$$$$Again I think that cancel culture is a laughably irrelevant issue that is almost only exploited by self-proclaimed cancellation victims as a publicity stunt but that^s just me. A substantial part of the left disagrees with cancellation too by the way ) Maybe we can find some common ground there?Next up: pronouns. This is a long one. I can tell you right now that your reaction tells me that you are misunderstanding the whole pronoun debate. If you want to get down to it sometime hit me up I am always ready to bust out the facts & logic.Last up: middle is best. I don^t want to disagree with you too hard on this. The thing is that there are some economic and social issues that the typically middle parties either don^t address or address in the wrong way. Take for example climate change. We as humanity have know about it for about 41 years now. Since the 80^s Yeah right? Most european countries and the US have had somewhat liberal/middle parties rule over them for the last 30 years. What has happened? Jack fucking shit. And the climate catastrophe moves ever forward. I just think that letting the market and ^our innovation & ingenuity^ solve the problem is not enough. The international climate panel was pretty fucking clear about the effects of climate change and when we will hit the point of no return. For reference you^ll have to read a bit more than wikipedia sorry:https://www.ipcc.ch/I just think that sometimes solutions are needed that also happen to be called radical. But radical is also very subjective and arbitrary.200 years ago womens^ right to vote was a radical thought that noone dared to express (in europe). And now the tables have turned the tides have shifted and womens^ right to vote is the most non-radical thing one could imagine. It is / will be the same with other policies I promise.I just want the climate crisis to be averted humans to live without poverty and generally a fair and equal society and I have determined that left-leaning policies are the way to go. If you disagree then I am happy to explain my train of thought. If you want to shitpost then there is no way for me to stop you. You would just look very stupid. Progressivism is the agonal breathing of a dying society the apex of western liberalism^s final moments. You people will wrap yourselves in so many layers of intersectionality in order to not offend your comrades that you^ll lose your own identity in the process. Then when people stand in your way and say ""no we don^t consent"" you^ll destroy their lives their families their jobs everything...because how dare they stand in the way of progress. The way I see it you and your Cringy Cuntlike Comrades are only a few years away from loading train cars of people like me and you^ll smile and wave your LGBTQIA+ flags while chanting shit about tolerance. hallo comrade i understand what is ur point u wanna think in social transformation in key of a open society in which people fight position of hegemony or discursive hegemony. i??m here to talk aout what??s happening in Colombia but i don??t have a fucking idea of how using deep web for searching information. i just want to learn and share whats happening here op^s username is accurate truly a monolith of cringiness I totally agree with john smith I probably do sound like a cunt :DAnd I am going to be significantly more cunt-like now that I have met some opposition so enjoyVee Vandetta has posted some interesting points so how about I address them eh?First of all: I am not forcing my views onto anyone here. I am putting out there where my views lie and letting you people know that I am open to speak about it. Not a triggered SJW who can^t take criticism haha.If you think that the left / socialists / communists are exactly like fascists then you don^t know what fascism means sorry but facts don^t care about your feelings snowflake. Here are a few contemporary definitions of fascism: you would rather have me summarize it: fascism is an authoritarian system/movement with EXTRA aspects such as hyper nationalism militarism hatred for progressivism and intellectualism enforcing an ethnic or religious hierarchy.Now if I interpret your issue correctly you are confusing fascism with authoritarianism. Yes the sowjet union and cuba and china have all been authoritarian dictatorships but that doesn^t make them fascist. There are some differences to nazi germany and mussolini^s italy for example. Rule of thumb: every fascist is an authoritarian not every authoritarian is a fascist - fascists are worse than authoritarians because of the things mentioned in the wikipedia article I encourage you to read.Next up: not every leftist is an authoritarian. In fact most leftists are anti-authoritarians. Take it from me I am a leftist. The left generally distances itself from the sowjet union an maoist china because those totalitarian states were horrid. And because they WERE NOT socialist/communist. How do we determine that fact? Let^s take a look at wikipedia again shall we :D ?:// put it in very broad terms: in order to be rightfully called communist a system must fit these two base criteria:1) democratic ownership & control of the means of production2) a classless moneyless society i.e. a decommodification of goods & services.Socialism even only takes the first of those two to be really socialist. There are many ways in which we can organize our economy to reach the communist/socialist end goal authoritarianism is not required. You will also notice that neither the sowjet union nor maoist china fit even the first criteria. Neither of them had worker ownership of the means of production they had party ownership. Big difference. Authoritarianism is not a prerequisite for socialism. Socialism doesn^t invariably lead to authoritarianism.Here is an example of extremely non-authoritarian socialism:_socialism I made this with an alt account opsec haha Hacking / learning to hack takes a long ass time and most people dont have the energy to care about politics at the same time. So naturally most hackers I know tend to be conservative or apolitical by default which sucks. There is a lot of political power in hacking and people are going to use it one way or another. The least we can do is to be responsible and well informed.So I ask you fine hacking folks if you want to get political with me. A little about me: I am a socialist/communist. I am a socialist when I am with my anarchist and social democrat comrades and a communist to trigger the right-wingers lol.I am critical of the capitalist system I am pro LGBTQ+ rights anti racist anti fascist anti-antisemitic pro feminist and generally use the intersectional model and critical theory to arrive at solutions for social problems. And I read sociological studies instead of fantasy novels so I know at least a little bit about the subject.If any of you have questions about ^da left^ or if you want a reasonable and nuanced leftie^s opinion on something or if you^d like an explanation of a certain topic like trans rights sex/gender antifa anything else just add something to this topic and LETS GET FUCKING EDUCATED  wow you really sound like a cunt. The left socialistic communists are exactly the fascists we need to guard against. I say fascist because they are. These SJW types. ie. I will force you to use any random pronoun i choose and you will have to comply or i will make your life hell.fascism 101.The solution is easy.Both extreme sides left and right. Liberal and conservative need to back the fuck down but this continuous escalation will only end in tears.  Center is the good place. A smidgen to the left or right is also fine but allow other their view without trying to convert or convince them. @cringeyC0mrade I loved our talks on that ""other"" platform.I will be back soon. Dealing with some minor legal issues and other IRL stuff.One day I might actually convert you to the horse shoe theory. I^m your opposite haha anarchist who wants to learn about hacking"

Hello everyone I suggest testing my Double SSH Tunnel Manager software - This is not a proxy like Proxifier this is a real router that can distribute the Internet from the Socks / SSH / Tor / VPN / YGGDRASIL protocols via WI-FI using only your own Wi-FI cardor via an Ethernet cable using your PC^s RJ45 port as well as via a virtual network to Virtualbox VmWare and Various Android Emulators.My software can use both DNS Socks and built-in DNS resolutions of your choice.In order to test the work you do not need to purchase or buy anything additionally since everything is available right out of the box (downloaded installed checked as software)Software works under OS Windows (preferably win 10 and above)Video examples of settings are shown on my YouTube channel.  is a free version in which all protocols except Socks5 will workYou can download and get more information here.https://www.ssh-tunnel.in/viewforum.php?f=5How can I use my software? For example you have an old laptop that you no longer use and you want to have a router in your house to which you would connect and find yourself in another country.Now many web resources are blocked in Russia and there is also a lot of censorship in Arab countries China and others.If you need mobility then take a look at the Chinese PC mele quieter3q n5105Thanks to all. If possible I always help to solve your problems through the telegram channel. Contacts are listed in the Double SSH Tunnel Manager header
"what about mega.nz? Staying SafeGet your tinfoil hats ready because security upgrades are comingPrivacy Checkers.Using one of the checkers below check that you^re currently displaying a Tor IP address and that all scripts are disabled. If they^re not that this is a privacy risk and you should continue to follow the advice below. Scripts Globally.When you first install Tor Browser bundle scripts via NoScript are globally allowed. This is very dangerous to your privacy and should be turned OFF. you can right click the no script icon (S icon next to address bar) and select optionsin general tab uncheck the scripts globally allowed tab.Blocking Embeddings.After you do that you need to block embedded scripts (which again are allowed by default) click on the S again and go to Options>Embeddings then click all the boxes to forbid Java Flash Silverlight Plugins <Audio/video> Iframe Frame and font-face and click OKBlocking Javascript directly. (about:config)After you have done this you still need to block JavaScripts in firefox in case Noscript ever fails to protect you or another exploit comes to light in the future. To block Javascript in the Tor browser Type about:config into the address bar click ^yes you know what you are doing^ scroll down (or type in the search box) javascript.enabled and change it to false by double clicking it.Blocking HTTP Referrer headers. (about:config) (Optional)Again Tor Project fail to have another security issue off by default. Referrers (for those that don^t know) provide information to sites your visiting about what site you came from eg: the full internet address. This should be OFF to protect your privacy. If your not still the ""about:config"" option repeat what you did to block javascript by typing about:config in the tor browser address bar.Then Look for network.http.sendRefererHeader and double click on it and change the value from 2 to 0.Then look for extensions.torbutton.saved.sendSecureXSiteReferrer and change it from ^true^ to ^false^ by clicking on it.Lastly look for network.http.sendSecureXSiteReferrer and change it from its default of ^true^ to ^false^ again by clicking on the value.So next time you open up a link it??ll block the referrer URL being passed on.Please Note: This is optional and turning Referrers off may prevent you downloading from clouds.New Tor Browser Slider settings.The new slider options should also be changed. Click on the Onion icon at the top of tor browser for the drop down menu and click ""Privacy and security settings"". ALL privacy boxes should be checked/ticked and on the slider it should be set to ^high^ for security level (by default is set as low).Plugins/Addons/P2P/Torrents/Webcam Sites.As stated already addons/plugins should be blocked and/or not installed at all. This includes ^DownThemAll^ NONE are supported by the TorProject and ALL run the risk of bypassing the Tor Network and accessing the net directly which runs the risk of leaking your real IP Address. Personally I^d rather have slower downloads and no knock on the door by LEA than faster downloads.Downloading.A lot of people keep asking about the download warning in Tor when you click to download something your given a warning followed by two options one is to OPEN the file While the other is to SAVE it. You should NEVER pick the option to ^open^ this would expose your real IP address (not Tor IP) to the website. So ALWAYS select Save and you remain hidden. If you go to Tor Browser Options (by clicking on the top left corner of your browser) Then go to Options>Options>Applications tab you can change the settings automatically. This will prevent you from accidentally opening a file in the browser instead of saving it. Since opening files will expose your IP address you don^t want to make that mistake. And change ^Portable Document Format (PDF)^ from ^Preview in tor browser^ to ^Save File^ and click ok. You could also as the warning message says use a VM such as Tails to help protect your downloads even more.It^s also worth saying some cloud/file host sites have a ""downloader"" (normally .Exe file) some of these are boxes already checked on the download page. Downloaders should NEVER be downloaded they contain spyware/malware and are optional So uncheck the downloader boxes before attempting to download the main file. They will deanonymous users and infect computers with malware if downloaded and opened.A recent honeypot site also told users to download a ""security scanner"" to confirm they are using tor correctly. The ""security scanner"" was in fact a program that once the users ran grabbed file names of window users along with victims real MAC and IP address and sent back to the site owner. NEVER download programs from ANY sources like this please use common sense if it smells bad then step away...Tails.Tails is a live operating system that you can start on almost any computer from a DVD USB stick or SD card. It aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity and helps you to: use the Internet anonymously and circumvent censorship all connections to the Internet are forced to go through the Tor networkleave no trace on the computer you are using unless you ask it explicitly use state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to encrypt your files emails and instant messaging.Its an extra layer of protection that a lot of people trust and use to learn more go to Whonix.An alternative to Tails and also an open source project. Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity privacy and security. It^s based on the Tor anonymity network Debian GNU/Linux and security by isolation. DNS leaks are impossible and not even malware with root privileges can find out the user^s real IP.Download from their official site only - Shredding history/cache/cookies and other footprints left behind.If you do use CCleaner I would recommend going to Options> Settings then clicking on the drop down menu and selecting ^Complex Overwrite (7 passes)^ and selecting ^secure file deletion^. And make sure all boxes are ticked on the ^Cleaner^ tab on the main program screen. Tick all boxes on the ^Windows^ and the ^Applications^ Tab. Then hit ^Analyze and Run cleaner. I would recommend using this before connection to tor and after you left Tor to wipe all cookies etc. I have also been told about a Add-on if you like for ccleaner this addon adds 100s more applications/cache/history/log files to ccleaners applications list.I would advise caution when using CCEnhancer tho its NOT supported by the company that makes ccleaner so its not beta tested like ccleaner is. And its use may lead to bugs or errors with windows. I would suggest if your not an advanced user then just keep using ccleaner on its own. If you^re an advanced user then CCEnhancer is great however not all on the new ""application list"" are even needed so please read every application and check that its needed before checking its box in ccleaners app list. Some of the logs are simply screen resolution settings etc and don^t need to be removed to protect privacy and would mean having to set your screen resolution etc on every reboot. So read the warnings carefully and remember no cleaning software can ever remove all traces all of the time.Ccleaner (for Reg Users)-  (for Advanced Users) - (Put in same folder as cclearner is in then click the ^download latest^ button on CCEnhancer and then check the new application boxes in ccleaner).Alternative & open source programs -Eraser - eraser.heidi.ieBleachBit - Accessing Tor on other devices.People keep asking if its safe to access Tor from phones/ipods and Tablets such as ipad the answer is No.Yes there is software that allows you to connect to Tor from such devices however its not full software and has a lot more weaknesses. Not to mention these type of devices have javascript/flash/silverlight and other software that can^t be turned off and well as backdoors and regularly send logs and check for app updates etc again which have no settings to turn them off. Which mean^s its highly likely at some point they will expose your real ip address and even if you don^t have the device registered or not registered in your name they all send back GPS info to the makers servers. This info is (in most countries US/EU) legally kept for two years so they know where you go where you livework or go to school. So ignore the BS developers who say these Tor apps are safe because they^re far from safe.Update: ALL apps have a secret personal embedded code when you download them from App stores. This information contains personal ID data which is available to all the developers of the apps you install on your device. The reason for this secret code/data is to prevent misuse/abuse of apps like chat or browser apps etc. For example say you get a bit too friendly on a dating app and post explicit images of yourself and the apps mods need to ban someone. They wont block the IP or registered email address since they can be changed easy They will block your phone itself with the help of this hidden code it contains a personal ID code for your app store ID as well as your phones serial code. This prevents people from simply using another email/IP address or simply deleting the app and downloading it again. But of course for security this is massive threat since even if you^re using whats meant to be anon service/app they will still have traceable information about your Apple account (which also has your ip address and probably in the case of a phone they will have your cellphone number logged even if the rest of the account info is fake) and phones personal serial code. I would also like to point out this is not just going on in apples store but ALL app stores on ALL devices so again don^t think you can ever be anon using apps even if the connection is meant to be anon/encrypted etc.Using Public/Hacked WiFi.Using someone else^s WiFi connection technically is no less safer than using your own (if accessing both over Tor and following the norm security advice). keep in mind i only mean the encrypted data is no less safer on public connection not the act of doing it. However I wouldn^t advice using public or hacked WiFi for the following reasons.1. The connection would still be encrypted from the WiFi owner but they could still work out where you were from from the WiFi signal strength. And they could also know that your using Tor (from the packets) as well as how much data you^re using. Which could lead to them investigating you more closely. They will also get your MAC address (Physical Address) of your Ethernet adapter/and your devices name (auto logging process when you access someone Else^s router) which could be used against you in court if they ever get physical access to your computer.2. As said public places have the Public I read 20+ news reports of people using public or hacked WiFi in public places as well as outside someones house (who^s had their WiFi hacked) and been caught red handed by chance mostly.3. It came out last year that an encryption company ran a test on computer encryption and basically broke what was said to be the worlds strongest encryption. How? By simply using audio devices to LISTEN to the sounds the computers made while someone was inputting their encryption pass phase. Tho this would be unlikely to be used often even with the 100% success rate its claimed to have and probably only used on terrorists under surveillance. However if you use the same public WiFi connections often and have raised suspicion in the past its possible this new technique could be used against you. Which would basically render even full disk encryption useless. This only breaks computer encryption when inputting passwords for it and do not however break any tor encrypted data traveling over the WiFi.4. Another thing people forget about when accessing someones WiFi connection for illegal purposes is Cell Phones. And you can bet LEA will contact all phone companies to order a list of all phones that where on and in that area at the time (If a criminal investigation is started). Even if a person hasn^t registered the phone itself the person can still be traced in many ways. The main being they know and log all a phones movements via their phone signals they can determine where the person is living from those records alone. On top of that the phone company still retains ownership over the SIM card in peoples phones so if a person has contacts saved on SIM card the phone company can send that information back to themselves thus getting peoples home phone numbers work numbers etc. As well and more than likely being about to trace how the cellphone was topped up eg where the person brought the credit from and with what method.. So the key point is don^t have a cellphone with you if you use other peoples WiFi for illegal purposes or if you do turn it off before going near the WiFi area. Keep in mind some older phones don^t totally turn off when you switch them off it^s been said some older phone basically go into power saving mode and are still on and check for updates etc. So best not to bring them at all or remove the battery instead.Windows 8 is not recommended at allAll new Windows 8 machines contain a chip called Trusted Platform Module (TPM) this chip is meant to block access to software and hardware which could be harmful to your system or avoid software conflicts (that^s the good news). The bad news is it also allows Microsoft FULL access to every Win 8 machine remotely the chip cannot be turned off in win 8 nor will a firewall anti-virus protect your system from Microsoft having full control over your system. Which of course means NSA and alike can also get access to machines/monitor cams take screen shots and record users undermine other security programs like encryption. The NSA tried making a backdoor chip (clipper chip) law years ago meaning it would be illegal to own a machine without such a backdoor chip however due to privacy the courts didn^t allow this law to pass. And now with Windows 8 comes with the chip that does just what the NSA wanted. Its not law that you have to use it so don^t. If you doubt this or think I^m being paranoid have a read of  Note: If you want to check if your PC has TPM chip you can hold the Windows button and press R. That should bring up the ""Run"" console. then type in ""tpm.msc"". Now you should have a form which tells you whether or not you have a TPM installed in your PC. Credit to Raykom @ H2TC for info.Media Players.When playing on topic stuff in your media player its recommended to be offline OR have that program blocked in your firewall from outgoing connections. Media players have a nasty habit of connecting directly to the internet (by passing tor network). They^re normally checking for updates but can also in some cases send back information including Real IP Address file names descriptions and Hash codes of the files themselves. Some offer free built-in subtitle searches which basically copy to hash code of the file your playing send it to their server and they scan it for a match to provide subtitles. If you pick to block the media player instead of being offline while viewing topic stuff on it don^t forget to check for updates for the player (since blocking outbound connections will prevent auto updates).TOR Exit Nodes.All traffic over Tor is encrypted and ISP^s cant see what your doing however after your requests have been bounced around to the different tor nodes the last node/computer on the tor network your connected to (known as a Exit Node) can see the traffic in plain text. They Do NOT see your real IP Address that is still hidden and was replaced with a tor ip from the first node (on connecting to the tor network you were given). But the exit node can find out where you have been what sites you have been looking at and if you input usernames/passwords they can see them as well. Some exit nodes have no logs some however are run by companies and people who actively record/log the exit node data. And of course it^s known some exit nodes are run by Governments around the world. So keep in mind they can see the information you request however cannot see your real ip address. So its advised not to link your tor identity to your real identity so NO shopping online or logging into your real email accounts etc. As from there they can see the information and link you to your real identity or LEA can for example request your account information/ip address of the user who owns that Amazon/ebay/youtube/gmail or other accounts. They can only see this information if the connection was not over a https (encrypted) so if there is a second layer of encryption they cant view that information. However its always my advice to avoid using tor even over https connection to access accounts that could possibly be linked back to your real identity.Cookies - How NSA is using Cookies to Track Tor users?Let^s suppose that there is a famous online shopping website owned or controlled by NSA. When a normal user will open that website from his own real IP address the website creates a cookie on the user ^ browser and stores real IP address and other personal information about the user.When the same user will again visit the same NSA owned website enabling Tor this time on the same browser - website will read last stored cookies from browser which includes the user^ real IP address and other personal Information. Further website just needs to maintain a database of Real IP addresses against the Tor Proxy enabled fake IP addresses to track anonymous users. More Popular the site is More users can be tracked easily. Documents show that the NSA is using online advertisements i.e. Google Ads to make their tracking sites popular on the internet.How you can avoid Cookie tracking?One browser can^t read the cookies created by other browser (As far as we know at the moment but this may change in the future or become public). So Don^t use Tor on the same browser that you use for regular use with your real IP address. Only use the standard Tor Browser Bundle instead for Anonymous activities. You should always clear the cookies (with ccleaner or alike) after you??re done so any stored information such as login information ?? will not be stored on that computer. If you^re doing something very interesting you should use Tor on a virtual machine with the live OS so that cookies and cache and other OS data are dumped when the machine is closed.Clearnet Warnings.Tor hidden services and Clearnet work differently.While accessing Tor hidden services over tor there is no Exit node (which could be used by malicious persons/governments).The connection is encrypted end to end if accessing tor hidden service over tor. And Instead of given an exit node you^re given SIX tor relays.Now accessing a ""clearnet"" link over tor you DO use an exit node and there is no end-to-end encryption (the exit node see all non https data in plain text and can log it). And the relay numbers go down to three entry node>mid relay>exit relay>Exit node.So whats the big problem? As long as you dont reveal personal information over tor the exit node is no real threat?The issue is IF an adversity control^s the exit node and two of the relays your currently using the experts say you can be deanonimised and the subject^s real IP address can be exposed to the adversity.To try to counter this threat The Tor project try to remove exit nodes that look like they could be malicious and or are using outdated software. Tor users are also given random tor relays and have exit nodes changed automatically every 10 minutes. This reduces the chances of a user ending up with possible malicious tor relays and exit nodes at the same time. But the risk is still real.Browser Fingerprinting.This is a problem area for us and impossible to completely migrate from. It^s known that governments use browser fingerprints to try separate users. Even with tor browser the browser gives out a lot of information about it. For example.What fonts are installed cookies HTTP headers your browser sends your current window size current language of software used version of software used list of all installed plugins and their versions list of all scripts allowed changes in about config settings etc. All this information is still freely available and can be used to try to work out which particular user accessed this site or that site. Of course a lot of tor users are blocking Javascript etc (which they should) so that will make us/our browser settings look the same. The more users that have the same browser settings the better but not everyone will have good OPSec. And will have plugins installed that will set them outside the crowd as well as risk IP exposure from those plugins. Browser Fingerprinting is current something people need to consider but it is over all a low level threat as long as you follow normal advice about scripts/plugins. And this information on its own is a threat to privacy but cant be used to expose peoples IP addresses unless for example they login to their clearnet accounts over tor and cookies expose that. But in that case exit nodes will already get that information if someone starts logging in to clearnet sites over tor. So overall something to keep in mind but not to worry about.Risks of Using different browsers at the same time.This comes up from time to time so worth adding. People ask if there a known threat/exploit to using another browser while using tor browser. The answer is yes and no. Currently there is no known technical threat. Tor browser is a standalone/independent browser and doesn^t communicate with other browsers nor does it share cookie files. However the threat lies in human error while using two browsers at once. For example you could use one browser to login to your real email providers account over tor instead of over your normal browser. If you did this then of course that would link you tor ID to your real ID and IP address linked to your real accounts. Or indeed log into other sites/services that are linked to your ID.- One man made the mistake of pasting an illegal link he copied from an illegal site from tor browser over to his reg browser and on his FACEBOOK wall....- Lulzsec ""Leader"" SABU (Hector Monsegur) and later FBI informant also made the cross browser mistake. While up late one night he was using both Firefox and Tor Browser while he logged into lulzsec^s IRC channel. Only problem after a few seconds he noticed the tor button was missing from the browser and then he realized his mistake he had logged into the channel using his firefox browser and not tor browser and leaked his real ip address to LE...- Many others had been busted because they downloaded illegal files from cloud services where the links were posted on tor. But they used their normal browsers to download the files and not tor browser.Correlating two users together on the internet is easier than you think.Let^s use YouTube for example. YouTube is owned by Google Google tracks everything. YouTube keeps track of which IP addresses search for what videos and tons of metadata about it??s users.When a link to a YouTube video is posted on tor boards you will use your regular browser to watch it because Tor browser should have all scripts blocked at all times so videos are unviewable. But the problem is if a post on Tor was written on January 10 2014 recommending a video and this video only has 500 views perhaps this video has been up for a few months and not very popular.And then within the few days that this article was posted 50 people viewing the Tor forum watch this video. The number of views just went up in a short period of time.It is pretty easy to correlate that it is possible that the people who watched that YouTube video especially since it is not a popular video came from the Tor hidden service the link was posted on and if you made the mistake of using your real IP address you have now been added to a list of people of interest. And if you do this multiple times with different YouTube videos then they start to see a pattern and before you know it they are confident that you are coming to watch these videos from tor hidden service because every time a video is posted on tor your IP address comes up to watch this video. And this method IS being used by LE to try to get peoples non-tor IP addresses. Continue part 2 here  As far as I know there is no ""secure"" way to access file sharing sites like mega.nz from the TOR Browser without ENABLING JavaScript. That leads many people to use their regular browsers for downloading content. Can anyone suggest a solution?"

Python^s readability makes it a great first programming language ?? it allows you to think like a programmer and not waste time with confusing syntax. ... If Python isn^t installed it^s easy to download and install. That^s why i write this tutorial :)introductionPython is a interpreted object-oriented high-level programming language.Python was created by Guido van Rossum and officially released in the year 1991.This language is still quite new and is one of the easier languages to learn.Another really great thing about python is that unlike many programming languages it does NOT require a semi-colon("""") at the end of every line.? Python comes pre-installed with Mac OS X andLinux.? Windows binaries from ? You might not have to do anythingRich built-in collection types: Lists Tuples Dictionaries (maps) SetsWhy python ? Good example of scripting language ??Pythonic? style is very concise Powerful but unobtrusive object system Every value is an object Powerful collection and iterationabstractions Dynamic typing makes generics easysimplified syntax and not complicated which gives more emphasis on natural language.Table of contents[*]Getting started[*]Variables[*]Operators[*]Logical Statements[*]Lists[*]Loops[*]Functions[*]Modules[*]Global Variables[*]Final words & CreditsGetting started First of all if you are going to be using python you have to install the interpreter first.You can download it from the official python website [url=][color=red]here[/color][/url].I recommend you download and install Python since Python 2.7 is outdated.just download  Python 3 :DIf you want to write your own Python programs you need to use an IDE  many begineers dont know full name of ide so full name is = integrated Development EnvironmentThere are a lot of different IDE^s for python personally i prefer PyCharm.If you are not yet familiar with python i recommend you use JetBrains PyCharm Edu which you can download for free [url=][color=#FFD700]here[/color][/url].This version of PyCharm offers you a diversity of tutorials aswell as extra help features.If you are familiar with python already i recommend you use JetBrains Pycharm Community Edition which you can download for free [url=][color=#FFD700]here[/color][/url].This version of PyCharm offers you alot more plugins and features.In python you can add a comment to your code using the hash symbol (^#^).Example:[code]#This is a comment[/code]If you wish to have multiple lines of comments you can enclose the lines of comments using the double quote symbol 3 times.Example:[code]""""""TheseAreMultipleLinesOfComments""""""[/code]Comments will always be ignored by the interpreter and are usually used to add some notes to a part of the code. (if u complete 1 project and you have to work after 2 months or long time that notes will helping to understand how you create that things :idea: )VariablesIn python variables are what you use to store values.The three most important variables in python are:[list][*]Integer[/list]An integer (int) is a variable where you can store a number that can be written without a fractional component.check blank box for check content or go to google and search about it [spoiler] [b]a = 70b = -50c = 0[/b][/spoiler][list][*]Float [/list]A float is a variable where you can store a number that is written with a fractional component.[spoiler][b]a = 80.42b = -50.99c = 0.000[/b][/spoiler][list][*]String[/list]An string is a variable where you can store characters if you enclose them in quotes.Python treats single quotes the same as double quotes.Example:[spoiler]a = ""Hello""b = ""World""c = ""Cyberjagu""[/spoiler]OperatorsPython has a lot of different operators such as mathematicial operators and comparison(logical) operatorsHere is a list of some of the mathematical operators[/color] python uses.[list][*][color=#FF0000]+[/color] [/list]This operator adds the value^s on both sides of the operator.[spoiler]a + b = 20[/spoiler]This operator substracts the value on the right side of the operator from the value on the left side of the operator.[spoiler]a - b = 10[/spoiler][list][*][color=#FF0000]*[/color][/list]This operator multiplies the values of on both sides of the operator.[spoiler]a * b = 100[/spoiler][list][*][color=#FF0000]/[/color][/list]This operator divides the value on the right side of the operator by the value on the left side of the operator.[spoiler]a / b = 1[/spoiler][list][*][color=#FF0000]%[/color][/list]This operator divides the value on the right side of the operator by the value on the left side of the operator [b]and returns the remainder[/b].[spoiler]a % b = 0[/spoiler][size=medium]Here is a list of some of the [color=#FFD700]comparison operators[/color] python uses.These are the operators you will be using when you are working with while statements and for loops etc.[/size][list][*][color=#FF0000]==[/color][/list]If the value of both operands are equal then the condition becomes true.[spoiler]if a == b:    print(""a is equal to b"")[/spoiler][/list]If the value of both operands are not equal then the condition becomes true.[spoiler]if a = b:    print(""a is not equal to b"")[/spoiler]If the value of the left operand is greater then the value of the right operand then the condition becomes true.[spoiler]if a > b:    print(""a is bigger then b"")[/spoiler]If the value of the left operand is less then the value of the right operand then the condition becomes true.[spoiler]if a < b:    print(""a is smaller then b"")[/spoiler]If the value of the left operand is equal to or bigger then the value of the right operand then the condition becomes true.[spoiler]if a >= b:    print(""a is equal or bigger then b"")[/spoiler]If the value of the left operand is equal or less then the value of the right operand then the condition becomes true.[spoiler]if a <= b:    print(""a is equal or smaller then b"")[/spoiler]Logical statements are [color=#FFD700]also known as if/else statements[/color].They are statements that check whether the conditions are true or false.In these statements we are going to use the comparison operators we just discussed.A common mistake i made when i started out with Python was forgetting to add the ^:^ after the If statement line. Don^t forget to add this if you don^t the statement won^t work and you will get an _error_.Example:[code]a = 10b = 10if a == b:    print(""a is equal to b"")else:    print(""a is not equal to b"")[/code]If you run this code it will print ""a is equal to b"" because both variables are 10.Example of a slightly more complicated if statement:[code]a = 10b = 10c = 20isittrue = Trueif a == c:    isittrue = Trueelif a == b:    isittrue = Trueelse:    print(""A is not equal to b or c"")    isittrue = Falseif a == b or a == c:    isittrue = Trueelse:    print(""A is not equal to b or c"")    isittrue = Falseif a == b and isittrue == True:    c = c - b    print(c)[/code]The first If statement checks if a is equal to c or if a is equal to b. Since a is equal to b the variable isittrue will be set to True.While this is a correct code programmers are lazy people and always strive to make their code as short as possible. That^s why the second If statement checks exactly the same as the first if statement but uses the or operator instead.This way the or operator saves 2 lines of code which in this case shouldn^t matter alot but if you are coding a big program efficient coding will save you alot of time.The third If statement checks if  a is equal to b and if the variable isittrue is set on True. If this is both the case (which it is) c will be set to be c - b. Basicly what happens is the variable c is now 20 - 10.After that the print statement will show 10 as the new value of the variable c.[align=center][size=xx-large][color=#8A2BE2]-----------------------------------[/color][color=#FFD700]-----------------------------------[/color][/size][/align][size=large][color=#FFD700]Lists[/color][/size]Lists are a very important part of python.A list is a variable that holds multiple values. A list in Python is similar to an array in Java. You can declare a list the same as any other variable except that it needs to be enclosed with brackets (""[]"") and seperated with commas("""").It^s very important to remember that lists work with positions.The first position is always 0 NOT 1Example:[code]list = [""One"" ""Two"" ""Three""]print (list)print(list[0])print(list[1])print(list[2])[/code]When you run this code you will get this output:[code][""One"" ""Two"" ""Three""]OneTwoThree[/code]You might wonder what just happened well:Print (list) tells python to print everything that is in the list which is why the commas and brackets get printed aswell.Print (list[0] tells python to print the first variable in the variables list.Print (list[1] tells python to print the second variable in the variables list.Print (list[2] tells python to print the third variable in the variables list.You might wonder why or how this could be usefull. I will get back to that later in this guide.In Python there are several kinds of loops.Right now we will discuss the two most important ones.This is one of the easiest and most basic loops of python. What a while loop does is perfor a series of events as long as something is in a certain condition. With the while loop you also need to add the colon sign after the line (^:^)Example:[code]a = 5while a > 0:    print (a)    a = a - 1print(""We are out of the loop"")[/code]As you can see first we declare a variable and then the while loop checks if the variable is bigger then 0.This while loop will keep running the events within it until a is equal to 0.So your output will be:[code]54321We are out of the loop[/code]You can use all comparison operators in a while loop to get the result you want.A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list a tuple a dictionary a set or a string).This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.With the for loop we can execute a set of statements once for each item in a list tuple set etc.The for loop is slightly more complex then the while loop but it^s still perfectly understandable.The for loop executes a sequence of statements multiple times.With the while loop you also need to add the colon sign after the line (^:^)Let me explain this loop with an example.[code]for x in range(5):    print (x)       Or fruits = [""apple"" ""banana"" ""cherry""]for x in fruits:  print(x)(try it your self :D)[/code]If you run this code your output will be:[code]01234[/code]The for loop goes through every item in a list before it can exit the loop.In this example ""x"" is a variable. It does not have a set value because it^s used to run the for loop. In simple terms: for x in a list with a range of 5 print xNow you might be wondering why does it stop at 4 when we said range 5?You have to remember that a for loop works with lists and as mentioned before the first position of a list is 0.Functions are very important when you are coding a program or script.A function is in simple terms a specific piece of code.A function is very efficient when you need to run a function multiple times for example in a loop.Here a simple example of a define:[code]def definitionname():    print(""This is my define."")definitionname()[/code]The ""def"" is how you start the definition. After that you put in a unique name for your definition. This can be anything you like.With the define you also need to add the colon sign after the line (^:^)If you want to run the code within the define you can call it by typing the name of the function with parameters (""()"")The output for the code above would be: This is my define.As mentioned before a function is especially efficient when you want to run the code in the function multiple times.For example:[code]def multipletimes():    print (""My very first define."")for x in range(5):    multipletimes()[/code]When you run this code your output will be:[code]My very first define.My very first define.My very first define.My very first define.My very first define.[/code]This is a very simple example but you can already see how efficient it is.This way the print statement is executed 5 times with only 4 lines of code. When you are coding a complex program or script defines will make your job a lot easierModules are python programs that you can use. These mudules are scripts written by another person in order for you to be able to make a fairly complex script/program without extensive knowledge about the functions you are using. To be able to use a module you first have to import it. You can simply do this by typing ^import^ and the Python module name.For example:[code]import time[/code]Time is a basic Python module that is included in the standard python package you downloaded at the start of this thread.You are now able to use this module.A simple example of how you can use the time module:[code]import timeseconds = time.time()print(""number of seconds since 10:00am Januari 1 1970:"" seconds)[/code]When you run this code the output will be something like: number of ticks since 10:00am Januari 1 1970: 1457813005.3186388You are probably thinking: How can i know every single module name and every statement within a module?The answer to that is simple. Google what you need For example if you want to make a running clock you can google: Python clock.In the results you will most likely find a site such as stackoverflow. On this site it will probably tell you that in order for you to make a clock in python you need to import the time module. At last i want to explain what global variables are and what you can use them for. First of all try to avoid global variables as much as possible With big scripts it would get really messy really quik.That being said a global variable is a normal variable not unlike the normal variables we discussed earlier in this thread.The difference between normal variables and global variables is that global variables are being used within loops and statements.For example:[code]x = 10def normalx():    x = 5normalx()print (x)def globalx():    global x    x = 20globalx()print (x)[/code]In this example we declare the variable x as 10. Then we run the function normalx and after the function has been ran we print x.Then we run the function globalx and after the function has been ran we print x again.When you run this code your output will be:[code]1020[/code]The reason for this is that in the first define x is not called as the global x. In the second define we do call x as global x which is why the global x variable has been changed from 10 to 20.Here are some recommendations:Whenever you are stuck either look up  and go to the python tutorial or look for solutions on stackoverflow.

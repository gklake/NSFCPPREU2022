"Kirby and the Forgotten Land is the first platform game in the series with full 3D gameplay, where the player must guide Kirby through various different stages to save the Waddle Dees at the end",0
"As in most Kirby games, Kirby can jump and slide as well as inhale enemies and objects which he can either spit out like projectiles or swallow to gain a copy ability",0
"]] Alongside returning copy abilities, this game introduced two new copy abilities in the form of Drill and Ranger,]] as well as an upgrade system for copy abilities and a new ""Mouthful Mode"" where Kirby can swallow and control larger objects, such as cars and vending machines",0
"] Similar to Kirby Battle Royale and Kirby and the Rainbow Curse, a second player can join in and play as Bandana Waddle Dee, who uses a spear as his main form of attack",0
"]The goal of each stage is to rescue the Waddle Dees, who are freed by finding them trapped in cages, as well as by accomplishing certain goals specific to each stage",0
"Once rescued, they are returned to Waddle Dee Town, the main hub of the game",0

]] The game also supports amiibo functionality,0
"]]One day on Planet Popstar, a dark vortex appears over Dream Land, sucking up everything in its path into an abandoned civilization called the New World",0
"Kirby is among those sucked into the vortex and also finds himself in the New World, where he discovers that the Waddle Dees from Dream Land are being kidnapped by the native wildlife, the Beast Pack",0
"Eventually, he finds the destroyed Waddle Dee Town and a chinchilla-like creature called Elfilin, who helped the Waddle Dees settle within Waddle Dee Town",0

"Kirby frees Dedede from the Beast Pack's mind control and ascends into their center of operations, Lab Discovera, to find Elfilin while Dedede stays behind to hold off the remaining Beast Pack members",0
"The lab's pre-recorded narration explains that a powerful extradimensional being named Fecto Forgo tried to invade the New World, but was captured by the planet's inhabitants and placed in the lab, where their ability to create space-time rifts was researched",0
"Thirty years after research began, Elfilin split apart from Fecto Forgo in a ""warp-experiment incident"" and escaped in the chaos, while Fecto Forgo was placed in permanent suspended animation within Lab Discovera's Eternal Capsule",0
"Kirby then meets the leader of the Beast Pack, a lion named Leongar, who is holding Elfilin captive",0
"Leongar explains that the previous inhabitants of the New World used Fecto Forgo's power to depart for ""a land of dreams,"" and that he intends to do the same by reuniting Fecto Forgo with Elfilin",0
"After Leongar is defeated, Fecto Forgo awakens; speaking through Leongar, they reveal that they had formed the Beast Pack, possessed King Dedede, and kidnapped the Waddle Dees in order to resume their invasion",0

"Using all his power, Elfilin seals the rift between the two worlds, with himself in the New World",0
"In the credits, though, it is revealed that Elfilin is able to open rifts to Popstar, and the inhabitants of the two worlds have become friends",0
"However, Leongar's soul remains trapped in an alternate dimension called Forgo Dreams, created by Fecto Forgo's lingering soul and populated by phantoms generated by their memories of the Beast Pack",0
"Kirby and Elfilin travel to this dimension and rescue Leongar, who is possessed by Soul Forgo",0
"Kirby defeats the possessed Leongar, separating Soul Forgo from his body",0
"Before they can attack Kirby, a scarlet butterfly flies into the lab, absorbs them, and transforms into Morpho Knight, a valkyrie-like warrior who delivers souls to the afterlife",0

HAL Laboratory had begun teasing a new Kirby game since 2020,0
"]] General director Shinya Kumazaki described it as the ""new phase"" for the series and that it will ""culminate the best aspects of Kirby""",0
"] Game director Tatsuya Kamiyama explained how the team focused on making the game approachable even with change of perspective to 3D, while at the same time making it satisfying to play to the player",0
"The 3D transition was described as very challenging, with Kamiyama being the one who made the pitch for a 3D game — which HAL struggled with for years, resulting in many cancelled projects — while also presenting solutions on how to make the transition to 3D, including character design, gameplay and many other aspects, finally allowing for development to begin on a 3D title after several failed attempts since the 2000s",0

"The upgradable copy abilities and Mouthful Mode were also heavily praised for the gameplay variety they provided while remaining a part of the game's core design, making the combat and platforming consistently interesting as a result",0
"Boss fights were also lauded for requiring the utilization of copy abilities, with several praising the increased difficulty of Forgotten Land in comparison to previous entries in the franchise",0
"The game's visuals and level themes were similarly commended, with the post-apocalyptic aesthetic of the game being cited as creative",0
Local co-op was praised for being fun and seamless while accommodating younger players,0

"A hacker is a person skilled in information technology who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means",1
Though the term hacker has become associated in popular culture with a security hacker– someone who utilizes their technical know-how of bugs or exploits to break into computer systems and access data which would otherwise be inaccessible to them – hacking can also be utilized by legitimate figures in legal situations,1
"For example, law enforcement agencies sometimes use hacking techniques in order to collect evidence on criminals and other malicious actors",1
"This could include using anonymity tools (such as a VPN, or the dark web) to mask their identities online, posing as criminals themselves",1
"]] Likewise, covert world agencies can employ hacking techniques in the legal conduct of their work",1
"On the other hand, hacking and cyber-attacks are used extra- and illegally by law enforcement and security agencies (conducting warrantless activities), and employed by state actors as a weapon of both legal and illegal warfare",1
"Reflecting the two types of hackers, there are two definitions of the word ""hacker"":Today, mainstream usage of ""hacker"" mostly refers to computer criminals, due to the mass media usage of the word since the 1990s",1
"] This includes what hacker slang calls ""script kiddies"", people breaking into computers using programs written by others, with very little knowledge about the way they work",1
This usage has become so predominant that the general public is largely unaware that different meanings exist,1
"] While the self-designation of hobbyists as hackers is generally acknowledged and accepted by computer security hackers, people from the programming subculture consider the computer intrusion related usage incorrect, and emphasize the difference between the two by calling security breakers ""crackers"" (analogous to a safecracker)",1
"The controversy is usually based on the assertion that the term originally meant someone messing about with something in a positive sense, that is, using playful cleverness to achieve a goal",1
"But then, it is supposed, the meaning of the term shifted over the decades and came to refer to computer criminals",1
"]As the security-related usage has spread more widely, the original meaning has become less known",1
"In popular usage and in the media, ""computer intruders"" or ""computer criminals"" is the exclusive meaning of the word today",1
"(For example, ""An Internet 'hacker' broke through state government security systems in March",1
""") In the computer enthusiast (Hacker Culture) community, the primary meaning is a complimentary description for a particularly brilliant programmer or technical expert",1
"(For example, ""Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, is considered by some to be a hacker",1
""") A large segment of the technical community insist the latter is the ""correct"" usage of the word (see the Jargon File definition below)",1
The mainstream media's current usage of the term may be traced back to the early 1980s,1
"When the term, previously used only among computer enthusiasts, was introduced to wider society by the mainstream media in 1983,] even those in the computer community referred to computer intrusion as ""hacking"", although not as the exclusive definition of the word",1
"In reaction to the increasing media use of the term exclusively with the criminal connotation, the computer community began to differentiate their terminology",1
"Alternative terms such as ""cracker"" were coined in an effort to maintain the distinction between ""hackers"" within the legitimate programmer community and those performing computer break-ins",1
"Further terms such as ""black hat"", ""white hat"" and ""gray hat"" developed when laws against breaking into computers came into effect, to distinguish criminal activities from those activities which were legal",1
"However, network news use of the term consistently pertained primarily to the criminal activities, despite the attempt by the technical community to preserve and distinguish the original meaning, so today the mainstream media and general public continue to describe computer criminals, with all levels of technical sophistication, as ""hackers"" and do not generally make use of the word in any of its non-criminal connotations",1
"Members of the media sometimes seem unaware of the distinction, grouping legitimate ""hackers"" such as Linus Torvalds and Steve Wozniak along with criminal ""crackers""",1
"]As a result, the definition is still the subject of heated controversy",1
"The wider dominance of the pejorative connotation is resented by many who object to the term being taken from their cultural jargon and used negatively,] including those who have historically preferred to self-identify as hackers",1
Many advocate using the more recent and nuanced alternate terms when describing criminals and others who negatively take advantage of security flaws in software and hardware,1
"Others prefer to follow common popular usage, arguing that the positive form is confusing and unlikely to become widespread in the general public",1
"A minority still use the term in both senses despite the controversy, leaving context to clarify (or leave ambiguous) which meaning is intended",1
"However, because the positive definition of hacker was widely used as the predominant form for many years before the negative definition was popularized, ""hacker"" can therefore be seen as a shibboleth, identifying those who use the technically-oriented sense (as opposed to the exclusively intrusion-oriented sense) as members of the computing community",1
"On the other hand, due to the variety of industries software designers may find themselves in, many prefer not to be referred to as hackers because the word holds a negative denotation in many of those industries",1
"A possible middle ground position has been suggested, based on the observation that ""hacking"" describes a collection of skills and tools which are used by hackers of both descriptions for differing reasons",1
"The analogy is made to locksmithing, specifically picking locks, which is a skill which can be used for good or evil",1
"The primary weakness of this analogy is the inclusion of script kiddies in the popular usage of ""hacker,"" despite their lack of an underlying skill and knowledge base",1
"Sometimes, ""hacker"" is simply used synonymously with ""geek"": ""A true hacker is not a group person",1
"He's a person who loves to stay up all night, he and the machine in a love-hate relationship",1
They're kids who tended to be brilliant but not very interested in conventional goals It's a term of derision and also the ultimate compliment,1
"""]Fred Shapiro thinks that ""the common theory that 'hacker' originally was a benign term and the malicious connotations of the word were a later perversion is untrue",1
""" He found that the malicious connotations were already present at MIT in 1963 (quoting The Tech, an MIT student newspaper), and at that time referred to unauthorized users of the telephone network,]] that is, the phreaker movement that developed into the computer security hacker subculture of today",1
Hacker culture is an idea derived from a community of enthusiast computer programmers and systems designers in the 1960s around the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT's) Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC)] and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,1
"] The concept expanded to the hobbyist home computing community, focusing on hardware in the late 1970s (e",1
"the Homebrew Computer Club)] and on software (video games,] software cracking, the demoscene) in the 1980s/1990s",1
"Later, this would go on to encompass many new definitions such as art, and life hacking",1
Security hackers are people involved with circumvention of computer security,1
"Among security hackers, there are several types, including:White hats are hackers who work to keep data safe from other hackers by finding system vulnerabilities that can be mitigated",1
White hats are usually employed by the target system's owner and are typically paid (sometimes quite well) for their work,1
Their work is not illegal because it is done with the system owner's consent,1
Black hats or crackers are hackers with malicious intentions,1
"They often steal, exploit, and sell data, and are usually motivated by personal gain",1
Their work is usually illegal,1
"A cracker is like a black hat hacker,] but is specifically someone who is very skilled and tries via hacking to make profits or to benefit, not just to vandalize",1
"Crackers find exploits for system vulnerabilities and often use them to their advantage by either selling the fix to the system owner or selling the exploit to other black hat hackers, who in turn use it to steal information or gain royalties",1
"A grey hat is a computer hacker or computer security expert who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical standards, but does not have the malicious intent typical of a black hat hacker",1
Four primary motives have been proposed as possibilities for why hackers attempt to break into computers and networks,1
"First, there is a criminal financial gain to be had when hacking systems with the specific purpose of stealing credit card numbers or manipulating banking systems",1
"Second, many hackers thrive off of increasing their reputation within the hacker subculture and will leave their handles on websites they defaced or leave some other evidence as proof that they were involved in a specific hack",1
"Third, corporate espionage allows companies to acquire information on products or services that can be stolen or used as leverage within the marketplace",1
"Lastly, state-sponsored attacks provide nation states with both wartime and intelligence collection options conducted on, in, or through cyberspace",1
]The main basic difference between programmer subculture and computer security hacker is their mostly separate historical origin and development,1
"However, the Jargon File reports that considerable overlap existed for the early phreaking at the beginning of the 1970s",1
An article from MIT's student paper The Tech used the term hacker in this context already in 1963 in its pejorative meaning for someone messing with the phone system,1
] The overlap quickly started to break when people joined in the activity who did it in a less responsible way,1
] This was the case after the publication of an article exposing the activities of Draper and Engressia,1
"According to Raymond, hackers from the programmer subculture usually work openly and use their real name, while computer security hackers prefer secretive groups and identity-concealing aliases",1
"] Also, their activities in practice are largely distinct",1
"The former focus on creating new and improving existing infrastructure (especially the software environment they work with), while the latter primarily and strongly emphasize the general act of circumvention of security measures, with the effective use of the knowledge (which can be to report and help fixing the security bugs, or exploitation reasons) being only rather secondary",1
"The most visible difference in these views was in the design of the MIT hackers' Incompatible Timesharing System, which deliberately did not have any security measures",1
"There are some subtle overlaps, however, since basic knowledge about computer security is also common within the programmer subculture of hackers",1
"For example, Ken Thompson noted during his 1983 Turing Award lecture that it is possible to add code to the UNIX ""login"" command that would accept either the intended encrypted password or a particular known password, allowing a backdoor into the system with the latter password",1
"He named his invention the ""Trojan horse""",1
"Furthermore, Thompson argued, the C compiler itself could be modified to automatically generate the rogue code, to make detecting the modification even harder",1
"Because the compiler is itself a program generated from a compiler, the Trojan horse could also be automatically installed in a new compiler program, without any detectable modification to the source of the new compiler",1
"However, Thompson disassociated himself strictly from the computer security hackers: ""I would like to criticize the press in its handling of the 'hackers,' the 414 gang, the Dalton gang, etc",1
The acts performed by these kids are vandalism at best and probably trespass and theft at worst,1
I have watched kids testifying before Congress,1
It is clear that they are completely unaware of the seriousness of their acts,1
"""]The programmer subculture of hackers sees secondary circumvention of security mechanisms as legitimate if it is done to get practical barriers out of the way for doing actual work",1
"In special forms, that can even be an expression of playful cleverness",1
"] However, the systematic and primary engagement in such activities is not one of the actual interests of the programmer subculture of hackers and it does not have significance in its actual activities, either",1
"] A further difference is that, historically, members of the programmer subculture of hackers were working at academic institutions and used the computing environment there",1
"In contrast, the prototypical computer security hacker had access exclusively to a home computer and a modem",1
"However, since the mid-1990s, with home computers that could run Unix-like operating systems and with inexpensive internet home access being available for the first time, many people from outside of the academic world started to take part in the programmer subculture of hacking",1
"Since the mid-1980s, there are some overlaps in ideas and members with the computer security hacking community",1
The most prominent case is Robert T,1
"Morris, who was a user of MIT-AI, yet wrote the Morris worm",1
"The Jargon File hence calls him ""a true hacker who blundered""",1
"] Nevertheless, members of the programmer subculture have a tendency to look down on and disassociate from these overlaps",1
They commonly refer disparagingly to people in the computer security subculture as crackers and refuse to accept any definition of hacker that encompasses such activities,1
"The computer security hacking subculture, on the other hand, tends not to distinguish between the two subcultures as harshly, acknowledging that they have much in common including many members, political and social goals, and a love of learning about technology",1
They restrict the use of the term cracker to their categories of script kiddies and black hat hackers instead,1
All three subcultures have relations to hardware modifications,1
"In the early days of network hacking, phreaks were building blue boxes and various variants",1
"The programmer subculture of hackers has stories about several hardware hacks in its folklore, such as a mysterious ""magic"" switch attached to a PDP-10 computer in MIT's AI lab that, when switched off, crashed the computer",1
] The early hobbyist hackers built their home computers themselves from construction kits,1
"However, all these activities have died out during the 1980s when the phone network switched to digitally controlled switchboards, causing network hacking to shift to dialing remote computers with modems when pre-assembled inexpensive home computers were available and when academic institutions started to give individual mass-produced workstation computers to scientists instead of using a central timesharing system",1
The only kind of widespread hardware modification nowadays is case modding,1
"An encounter of the programmer and the computer security hacker subculture occurred at the end of the 1980s, when a group of computer security hackers, sympathizing with the Chaos Computer Club (which disclaimed any knowledge in these activities), broke into computers of American military organizations and academic institutions",1
"They sold data from these machines to the Soviet secret service, one of them in order to fund his drug addiction",1
"The case was solved when Clifford Stoll, a scientist working as a system administrator, found ways to log the attacks and to trace them back (with the help of many others)",1
"23, a German film adaption with fictional elements, shows the events from the attackers' perspective",1
"Stoll described the case in his book The Cuckoo's Egg and in the TV documentary The KGB, the Computer, and Me from the other perspective",1
According to Eric S,1
"Raymond, it ""nicely illustrates the difference between 'hacker' and 'cracker'",1
"Stoll's portrait of himself, his lady Martha, and his friends at Berkeley and on the Internet paints a marvelously vivid picture of how hackers and the people around them like to live and how they think",1
Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a 2020 social simulation game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch; it is the fifth main entry in the Animal Crossing series,0
"In New Horizons, the player controls a character who moves to a deserted island after purchasing a getaway package from Tom Nook, accomplishes assigned tasks, and develops the island as they choose",0
"They can gather and craft items, customize the island, and develop it into a community of anthropomorphic animals",0
New Horizons began its development in 2012,0
"The game director, Aya Kyogoku, retained old content from previous games to keep fans happy and also ensured that the game was simple enough to appeal to newcomers",0
"With art and graphics, the developers used the concept of ""trigger of play"" and the ""imagination gap"", where the former kept the gameplay simplistic and easy to pick up while the latter kept the art style simple for the player to imagine the rest",0
"The game was announced at E3 2019 via a Nintendo Direct and after an extended development period, released worldwide March 20, 2020",0
"New Horizons received acclaim from critics, who praised its gameplay and customization options and called it the best game in the Animal Crossing series",0
The game was nominated for over a dozen awards and was a contender for Game of the Year,0
"It was a major commercial success, selling over 38",0
64 million copies worldwide and breaking the console game record for most digital units sold in a single month,0
"It is the best-selling game in the Animal Crossing series, the second best-selling game on the Nintendo Switch, the best-selling game of all time in Japan, and the 13th best-selling video game in history",0
Its commercial success has been attributed in part to its release amid global stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic,0
"The game has been used as a substitute for social interactions such as weddings and graduation ceremonies, as well as political campaigning and virtual protests",0
"The game also inspired fan creations, such as a trading website, a talk show, and other comics and merchandise",0
"It also received major updates adding new content until November 5, 2021",0
"As in previous Animal Crossing games, New Horizons is a life simulation game played in real time",0
"Weather also adjusts to the seasons of the Northern or Southern Hemisphere, depending on the player's real-world location, a first for the Animal Crossing series",0
"The game follows a villager customized by the player, who, after purchasing a getaway package from Tom Nook, moves into a deserted island",0
"After Tom Nook gives the player essentials, such as a tent, the game proceeds in a non-linear fashion, allowing for the player to play the game as they choose",0
"The player is given open access to natural resources such as fruit and wood, which can be collected and crafted into a variety of items and furniture known as D",0
crafting,0
"Alongside this, they can catch bugs and fish, plant and grow trees and flowers, extract natural resources such as rocks, and swim in the ocean",0
The island gives open space for placing items and decorating as the player chooses,0
"Certain content available, such as organisms, are season-dependant and only appear for a limited time of the year",0
"Doing simple tasks rewards the player with ""Nook Miles"", which in return can purchase premium rewards in Resident Services",0
"The other currency ""Bells"", a staple in the Animal Crossing franchise, can be used to purchase other goods and services",0
"Another feature offered early on is the ""Dodo Airlines"", an airport; through Dodo Airlines, and tickets purchased through Nook Miles, the player can visit other vacant islands to harvest resources, and meet other villagers",0
The player can invite other villagers they meet to their island if they choose,0
"The player starts with two other random anthropomorphic villagers that also purchase the getaway package; these villagers will live alongside the player and can be interacted with, building relationships",0
"When the player has made sufficient progress in the game, Tom Nook gives more freedom of expanding as a village",0
"Other shopowners will visit and settle on the island; museum-owner Blathers, who will display fish, bugs, sea creatures, fossils, and art captured by the player; sisters Mabel and Sable, who sell clothing and other player-created accessories; and Timmy and Tommy, who run a store that specializes in selling furniture and other quality-of-life items, eventually expanding to sell more items per day",0
"Eventually, the main area will expand to a Town Hall, run by Tom Nook with the help of Isabelle; other buildings and villagers will populate the community, and old tents and shops will grow into a more permanent structure that can still be moved if the player chooses",0
"From there, the island will be given a star rating out of five, usually starting off at a one-star rating",0
"As the island is further developed, the island's star rating will increase",0
"When a three-star rating is achieved, K",0
"Slider, a popular musician, will visit and perform a concert at the island, marking the ""end"" of the game as the credits roll",0
"However, more options for island customization are given to the player for further community growth, such as the ability to construct and destroy cliffs, bodies of water and paths, colloquially referred to as terraforming",0
The game supports one island per Switch system,0
"Animal Crossing: New Horizons supports both local and online co-op gameplay, with up to four players locally and eight players online able to occupy an island at any given time, an option available through the Dodo Airlines",0
"The game supports amiibo cards and figures from the Animal Crossing series, which can be used to invite a villager to the island temporarily that can be convinced to join the island",0
"Nintendo Switch Online cloud saving was added during a late July 2020 update, allowing users to recover game data if their Switch is broken or lost",0
"Additional free content was added every few months, added on every update by downloading the latest update from Nintendo, but major updates ceased with the release of the version 2",0
"0 update on November 3, 2021",0
"Since the game depends on seasonal changes, New Horizons receives frequent updates, adding new seasonal items, events, and sometimes new gameplay features",0
"Most updates are loosely based around national holidays, with the first update being themed around ""Bunny Day"" in April 2020 and based on Easter",0
"Other seasonal updates followed, being ""Nature Day"" (Earth Day), May Day, Halloween, ""Turkey Day"" (Thanksgiving), and ""Toy Day"" (Christmas)",0
"Other popular seasonal events, such as summer, also came with new items",0
Each respective update also featured popular characters from past Animal Crossing games,0
"With each update, the island changed in look, and the player's island is often decorated for the occasion",0
"Alongside seasonal changes, Nintendo has also released themed items from other popular media, such as Mario outfits and decor in celebration of the franchise's 35th anniversary",0
"In an October 2021 New Horizons-focused Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced the version 2",0
0 update would be released the following month and would be the final major free content update for the game,0
"The update added returning characters Kapp'n and Brewster, both bringing new activities and locations to the game, as well as the ability to fund permanent locations for the game's random visiting vendors",0
"Alongside other quality-of-life improvements, it also included new purchasable items, such as furniture and music, new villagers, and the ability to cook food via farmed crops",0
"Announced alongside the update was paid downloadable content, entitled Animal Crossing: New Horizons – Happy Home Paradise; similar to the 2015 spinoff Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer, the expansion allows players to visit a distant island and design vacation homes for villagers, and adds new customization options that can also be used on players' personal islands once learned",0
The version 2,0
"0 update released on November 3, 2021, and the Happy Home Paradise add-on released on November 5, 2021",0
"Development of a new main series Animal Crossing game for the Nintendo Switch was confirmed in a Nintendo Direct on September 13, 2018, with an unspecified 2019 release date",0
"Although the game was announced in 2018, game director Aya Kyogoku confirmed that the game had begun development in 2012, shortly after the original release of Animal Crossing: New Leaf for the Nintendo 3DS in Japan; she stated how concepts for the game were forming long before ideas for the Nintendo Switch had even existed",0
Hisashi Nogami and Katsuya Eguchi reprised their roles as the game's producers,0
"Nintendo released the game's title and first trailer at its E3 2019 Nintendo Direct on June 11, 2019",0
"The game was delayed until March 20, 2020, with Yoshiaki Koizumi stating that in order ""to ensure [that] the game [was] the best it [could] be, [Nintendo had to] ask that [players] wait a little longer than [Nintendo itself] thought",0
""" Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser cited a desire to avoid crunch and maintain a healthy work–life balance for Nintendo employees as the primary reason for the delay",0
Nintendo's stock market value posted a 3,0
"5% loss in reaction to the delay, amounting to a total loss in value of more than US$1 billion",0
"Kyogoku stated that the success of the Animal Crossing series was due to the fact that the developers make each game different enough from the last, to bring appeal to newcomers yet keep the core concept for returning players",0
"Kyogoku and Nogami stated that they selected a deserted island as the game's setting to differentiate it from previous Animal Crossing games, which are set in established villages, and to allow greater freedom to customize the game's world",0
"Additionally, a deserted island took away established parameters in the series to allow for different ideas and player interactions",0
"Other concepts, such as the internet and multiplayer, were able to be implemented, unlike previous games due to advancing hardware",0
Kyogoku made sure to keep balance of introducing new and fresh ideas while retaining core elements to satisfy long-term fans of the series,0
The developers were very disappointed when the game's release cycle overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic,0
"Due to quarantine during the pandemic, Kyogoku hoped that the game would be an ""escape"" for fans at the time",0
They emphasized a global release to allow for international connections between the players,0
The developers made sure to make the game not only welcoming new players but to also retain core concepts from the previous games to keep older fans of the series happy,0
A crafting system was implemented to allow the player to keep the player from running out of things to do after the in-game stores close,0
She mentioned how the D,0
crafting system would keep players in theme with the game by interacting and using the natural environment to their advantage,0
"Kyogoku took note of players who began playing Animal Crossing games via mobile apps, such as Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, by implementing the Nook Miles feature which would show the player what kinds of activities and concepts they can achieve by rewarding them to do so",0
The Nook Miles system also rewards the player for doing common tasks and collecting materials that would sell for cheap to keep the player from only tediously searching out expensive materials,0
Furniture and clothing accessibility and customization were emphasized for multiplayer so players could show pride in their islands,0
"Additionally, the developers noticed that players would repeatedly restart games in the previous series over and over, in hopes to get an island shape that they want",0
"Because of this, landscaping was implemented to allow for easy shaping of the island",0
"Another issue they noticed was ""time-traveling""; due to the game running in real-time, players would change the clock on the console to put themselves further into the future so they don't have to wait in real-time",0
"To help avoid this, they made sure landscaping and crafting did not have any wait-time restrictions",0
They also tied seasonal events to updates instead of implementing the content into the game from the beginning so players could not skip ahead and retrieve exclusive items,0
The interest rate in the game's bank system was also decreased to lower the incentive of time-traveling,0
"Although the developers intended no time-traveling to be the ideal way of playing, they did not shun the concept entirely",0
"The game's art director, Koji Takahashi, went under the philosophy of ""trigger of play""",0
The concept makes sure there is something within the player's field of vision or grasp that would want them to explore the concept,0
"With this, the island was designed from a 45-degree angle similar to that of a cylinder, or a ""curved"" perspective, where the player could view other content occurring in the background that would ""trigger"" them to investigate further or interact",0
"By making an everyday concept simple and easy to grasp, it would cause the player to explore it further and be able to easily pick up the new material",0
"If the game's art was complicated and realistic, according to Takahashi, the player would possibly receive too much information and make progression difficult",0
"The simple design allowed for a multiple of one object to be stacked close to each other, such as flowers, or allow for simplistic objects to compliment others",0
"By leaving empty space and with a simplistic design, with simple graphics and little nature complexity, Takahashi explains how it would have the player attempt to fill in that gap with their own perspectives and ideas, called the ""imagination gap"", and further motivation to create their own designs and space with the features available",0
"In the game, the grass is designed to look like that of a checkerboard",0
"Although this concept was in prior titles due to a lack of hardware complexity, the concept remained because it could be used as a form of expression for the player and allow them to conceptualize ideas with the ""imagination gap""",0
"Art designer Hiromi Sugimoto made sure furniture would lead to motivation and hard work, and thus make the player want to connect with others to show off their achievements",0
He made sure the furniture could be customized by the player to ensure the difference between islands that would motivate visiting others and seeing unique ideas,0
"Each furniture model was designed to have a ""likeness"" to it which would show exactly what to expect and what the player envisions; the pieces of furniture and items implemented various portions on how players view an object to look like and combine the commons ideas into one model",0
"From there, using the ""imagination gap"", the player could fill in the smaller nitpicky info they would expect and further imagine how they could use the item",0
"When Animal Crossing: New Horizons released on March 20, 2020, video game retailer EB Games attracted criticism for allowing fans who pre-ordered the game along with Doom Eternal to line up at its flagship Canadian location on Yonge Street, Toronto amid a COVID-19 pandemic in the country, when all levels of government urged the public to close non-essential businesses and maintain social distancing",0
"Touching on New Horizons in a December 2020 interview with Polygon, Doug Bowser stated the game sold ""well beyond expectations"", and applauded the developers for their efforts",0
He noted the game would continue to see updates all throughout 2021,0
A security hacker is someone who explores methods for breaching defenses and exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network,1
"] Hackers may be motivated by a multitude of reasons, such as profit, protest, information gathering,] challenge, recreation,] or evaluation of a system weaknesses to assist in formulating defenses against potential hackers",1
"The subculture that has evolved around hackers is often referred to as the ""computer underground""",1
"]Longstanding controversy surrounds the meaning of the term ""hacker""",1
"In this controversy, computer programmers reclaim the term hacker, arguing that it refers simply to someone with an advanced understanding of computers and computer networks] and that cracker is the more appropriate term for those who break into computers, whether computer criminals (black hats) or computer security experts (white hats)",1
"]The subculture around such hackers is termed network hacker subculture, hacker scene, or computer underground",1
It initially developed in the context of phreaking during the 1960s and the microcomputer BBS scene of the 1980s,1
It is implicated with 2600: The Hacker Quarterly and the alt,1
"In 1980, an article in the August issue of Psychology Today (with commentary by Philip Zimbardo) used the term ""hacker"" in its title: ""The Hacker Papers""",1
"In the 1982 film Tron, Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) describes his intentions to break into ENCOM's computer system, saying ""I've been doing a little hacking here""",1
"By 1983, hacking in the sense of breaking computer security had already been in use as computer jargon,] but there was no public awareness about such activities",1
"] However, the release of the film WarGames that year, featuring a computer intrusion into NORAD, raised the public belief that computer security hackers (especially teenagers) could be a threat to national security",1
"This concern became real when, in the same year, a gang of teenage hackers in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, known as The 414s, broke into computer systems throughout the United States and Canada, including those of Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Security Pacific Bank",1
"] The case quickly grew media attention,]] and 17-year-old Neal Patrick emerged as the spokesman for the gang, including a cover story in Newsweek entitled ""Beware: Hackers at play"", with Patrick's photograph on the cover",1
] The Newsweek article appears to be the first use of the word hacker by the mainstream media in the pejorative sense,1
"Pressured by media coverage, congressman Dan Glickman called for an investigation and began work on new laws against computer hacking",1
"House of Representatives on September 26, 1983, about the dangers of computer hacking, and six bills concerning computer crime were introduced in the House that year",1
"] As a result of these laws against computer criminality, white hat, grey hat and black hat hackers try to distinguish themselves from each other, depending on the legality of their activities",1
"These moral conflicts are expressed in The Mentor's ""The Hacker Manifesto"", published 1986 in Phrack",1
"Use of the term hacker meaning computer criminal was also advanced by the title ""Stalking the Wily Hacker"", an article by Clifford Stoll in the May 1988 issue of the Communications of the ACM",1
"In computer security, a hacker is someone who focuses on security mechanisms of computer and network systems",1
"Hackers can include someone who endeavors to strengthen security mechanisms by exploring their weaknesses and also those who seek to access secure, unauthorized information despite security measures",1
"Nevertheless, parts of the subculture see their aim in correcting security problems and use the word in a positive sense",1
"White hat is the name given to ethical computer hackers, who utilize hacking in a helpful way",1
"Raymond, author of The New Hacker's Dictionary, advocates that members of the computer underground should be called crackers",1
"Yet, those people see themselves as hackers and even try to include the views of Raymond in what they see as a wider hacker culture, a view that Raymond has harshly rejected",1
"Instead of a hacker/cracker dichotomy, they emphasize a spectrum of different categories, such as white hat, grey hat, black hat and script kiddie",1
"]A white hat hacker breaks security for non-malicious reasons, either to test their own security system, perform penetration tests or vulnerability assessments for a client, or while working for a security company which makes security software",1
